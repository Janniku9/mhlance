      So you've made it to Master Rank, congrats! Things are going to get significantly more
      challenging from here. Monsters are more aggressive with new movesets, hit considerably
      harder, and have much larger health pools.

      So you've made it to Master Rank, congrats! Things are gonna get a bit more difficult from
      here. Monsters will hit harder, attack faster and are also more tanky. But don't worry,
      because in this section we'll go over some builds that will help you get through the Sunbreak
      story.
    </p>

    <p>
      Master Rank weapons no longer have rampage skills. Instead they have rampage slots and there's
      Rampage Decorations that can be slotted into them. We can already craft some really powerful
      ones at MR1. The ones we want are the anti-species ones: anti air, anti aquatic, anti Dragon
      and anti fanged. If using the correct one against a monster we get a 5% Raw Damage boost. Here
      you can find a chart that shows which Decoration works against which monster:

    <p>
      After reaching Elgado, Utsushi will teach us Scroll swapping as well as new Switch Skills. For
      Lance we get an alternative to Guard Dash called Shield Tackle. It's quite useful and can
      change the way we play the weapon. So if you are interested in trying it out, make sure to
      check out the Switch Skills Guide:
    </p>

    <p>
      After defeating a Daimyo Hermitaur we'll arrive at the Elgado Outpost. Soon after we'll unlock
      a new locale: The Jungle. The first few quests encourage us to explore The Jungle and gather
      some materials.
    </p>

    <p>
      We want to mine as many Outcrops as possible so we can craft our first Master Rank Lance. Once
      again we'll be switching back to the Ore Tree with the Elder Babel Spear+.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the armor we'll be mostly using Barroth armor. It's really good since it comes with most
      Core Skills we want. Some of the armor pieces are so good we're gonna be using them for a long
      time.

      After hunting a Blood Orange Bishaten we'll get to two stars. After completing the first few
      Key Quests we'll be tasked with hunting an Anjanath. After completing this quest there's
      multiple things we want to do.
    </p>

    <p>
      We unlock Master Rank Jyuratodus which lets us craft Ironwall+3 jewels. We can also get
      Purecrystals now from mining in the Flooded Forest and use them to craft the Master Rank Ingot
      Greaves, a really solid leg piece we've used before.
    </p>

    <p>
      Follower Quests also unlock here, letting us bring NPCs from Kamura Village and Elgado on
      hunts with us. We want to follow this questline by completing 'An Audience with the Queen' and
      'Flicker in the Night' which unlocks the Squire armor set. The coil is particularly good and
      we'll be using it in our build.

      Garangolm is the first of the Three Lords of Elgado. Successfully hunting it brings us to
      Three Stars. With Garangolm comes a new locale: The Citadel, featuring a huge ruined castle, a
      thick muddy swamp and icy caves.
    </p>

    <p>
      We can get new materials from Bonepiles and Mining Outcrops in The Citadel. Using these we'll
      upgrade our Lance to the Lost Babel Lance.
    </p>

    <p>
      After doing the first few Key Quests we'll also unlock Aurora Somnacanth, a new Subspecies.
      Since there's not really much to craft at this rank we'll just focus on completing the
      remaining Key Quests.

  <Section title="Ice Wolf, Red Moon - 4⭐">
    <p>
      We're gonna get to fight the second lord of Elgado: the icy wolf Lunagaron. We want to craft
      its weapon and some armor pieces, so be prepared to hunt it a few times. The Lunagaron Lance
      is gonna be our first Lance with purple Sharpness.
    </p>

    <p>
      Diablos shows up in the Key Quests here. Back in High Rank we used his chest piece for Guard
      and Offensive Guard. The Master Rank version is pretty much an upgraded version of it so we
      definitely want to craft it.
    </p>

    <p>
      After completing a few Key Quests we'll unlock an Urgent Quest that brings back Astalos. Once
      you beat it, Utsushi will give you the final Switch Skills: Skyward Thrust and Sheathing
      Retreat. Check out the Switch Skills Guide to see how they work:
    </p>

    <p>
      To reach 5 stars we need to beat the third lord: the Elder Dragon Malzeno. He's the flagship
      monster of Sunbreak and one of the coolest fights in the game. All we do in this rank is use
      his materials to upgrade our Lunagaron Lance one more time.
    </p>

    <p>
      After that we just need to complete the remaining Key Quests and Urgent Quests to finish the
      story. We still have Shagaru Magala and the final boss left to tackle.

      With beating Gaismagorm, the final boss of Sunbreak, we'll unlock 6 star quests. But don't
      worry, the game is far from over. There's still a lot of new monsters left to hunt. Risen
      Elders, new Subspecies, returning monsters and most importantly Anomaly Investigations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our next objective is to reach MR10 which will unlock a lot of new content and build options.
