      Welcome to High Rank! After defeating Apex Arzuros, you'll face tougher versions of familiar
      monsters along with exciting new challenges. These monsters hit harder and have more health,
      so upgrading your gear becomes crucial for both offense and defense.
    </p>

    <MHRChefInfoBox />

    <p>
      Guardian weapons and Blackbelt Armor were added as catch-up gear for Sunbreak's release. While
      these pieces are powerful and easy to obtain, I strongly recommend avoiding them on your first
      playthrough. A core part of Monster Hunter's experience is exploring different armor skills,
      farming materials, and crafting various sets. However, the choice is yours.
    </p>

    <p>I've included builds for both progression paths below.</p>
  </Section>

  <Section title="The Rampage Continues - 4⭐">
    <p>
      High Rank 4 star is our first stepping stone. While there aren't many new monsters yet, we'll
      focus on upgrading our gear to prepare for tougher challenges ahead.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our weapon upgrade requires ores from the Lava Caverns - I'll explain how to get these when we
      discuss the Ingot Greaves S below. For armor, start by hunting a High Rank Lagombi for its
      helm.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can craft High Rank versions of several Low Rank pieces using gathered materials. We'll
      upgrade to the Hunter's Mail S and Kamura Braces S for improved defense.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Ingot Greaves S are slightly tricky to obtain early but worth the effort. You'll need to
      access the Lava Caverns through the Event Quest 'Out of Sight, Out of Mind's Eye', join the
      quest, mine the necessary ores, and return from quest.
    </p>

    <p>
      The crown jewel of this set is the Skalda/Spio Coil with Weakness Exploit 2. While obtaining
      it requires farming Toxic Kumori from the Argosy (a rare byproduct from herbs and fish at the
      Icebarb Bazaar), the massive damage boost makes it worth the effort.
    </p>

    <BuildCard
      build={{
        title: 'high rank entry set',
        description: [
          "This is our first set with Weakness Exploit, one of the most impactful damage skills for lance. Combined with the Paladin Lance II's blue sharpness, this set marks a significant power spike in our progression. The 55% affinity means we'll be landing critical hits more than half the time!",
        ],

            peak: 55,
          },
        },
      }}
    />
  </Section>

  <Section title="Catching A Fish In The Mud - 5⭐">
    <p>
      After defeating Jyuratodus in the Urgent Quest, we gain access to 5 star Hub Quests. While we
      won't make massive changes to our build here, we'll add some important upgrades.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Rampart Lance, craftable with Flooded Forest ores, becomes our next weapon upgrade. More
      exciting is our access to High Rank Barroth - its armor is even better than the Low Rank
      version, providing our first taste of Offensive Guard through the helm and arms.
    </p>

    <p>
      We can now craft our first decorations! Focus on the Diversion Jewel to maintain monster
      attention and Speed Sharpening jewels to compensate for our current lack of sharpness
      management skills.
    </p>

    <p>
      Don't forget to complete the 'Learn the Lance' quest to unlock Spiral Thrust, a powerful
      Switch Skill. If you haven't already, crafting 8 different lances will unlock Instablock, the
      most powerful switch skill if mastered to perfection.

      }}
    />
  </Section>

  <Section title="A Bewitching Dance - 6⭐">
    <p>
      Defeating Mizutsune opens up 6 star Hub Quests, giving us access to two key monsters: High
      Rank Zinogre and Rathalos. Their armor pieces are significant upgrades: specifically the
      Zinogre Mail S and Rathalos Braces S.
    </p>

    <p>
      For those who enjoy multiplayer hunts, this is where we can craft the essential Flinch Free
      jewel using Zinogre and Mizutsune materials - no more getting knocked around by your
      teammates!
    </p>

        title: 'weakness exploit master',
        description: [
          "This set maximizes our Weakness Exploit potential at the cost of one Attack Boost level. The trade is worth it - hitting weak spots with 60% affinity means we're landing critical hits more consistently.",

        ],

          },
        },
      }}
    />
  </Section>

  <Section title="The Wandering Widow - 7⭐">
    <p>
      After taking down Rakna-Kadaki, we unlock both 7 star Hub Quests and a crucial new melding
      method. This improved melding system gives us better odds at specific skills - we'll use it to
      craft a Weakness Exploit talisman, enabling us to use the powerful Diablos Mail S.
    </p>

    <p>
      The biggest upgrade comes from switching to the Diablos Lance. Don't let its negative affinity
      scare you, its tremendous raw attack power more than makes up for the occasional missed
      critical hit, especially with our Weakness Exploit skill helping to offset the penalty.
    </p>

    <BuildCard
      build={{
        title: 'defense is the best offense',
        description: [
          "Despite its negative affinity, the Diablos Lance's raw power makes it our best option at this point.",
          "The set gives us more Offensive Guard levels plus our first level of Guard, making our defensive capabilities much more reliable. Don't let the negative affinity scare you - our Weakness Exploit skill helps offset it significantly.",

        augments: ['attack'],
        additionalNotes: {
          'important rampage skill':
            'The Attack II rampage skill needs to be added while the weapon is still in the bone tree, before upgrading to the Diablos path. This is crucial for maximizing our damage output.',
        },
      }}
    />
  </Section>

  <Section title="Serpent Goddess Of Thunder - 8⭐">
    <p>
      Congratulations on defeating Narwa! While this technically completes the High Rank story,
      there's still plenty of content to explore. Though you could jump straight into Master Rank, I
      strongly recommend farming the newly unlocked decorations first - they're incredibly powerful
      and will serve you well in both late High Rank and early Master Rank.
    </p>

    <p>
      The new charm melding options are also worth exploring. Focus on getting a talisman with Level
      3 and Level 2 slots, this combination is invaluable for both our High Rank endgame builds and
      early Master Rank progression. Additionally try to craft the following decorations:
    </p>

    <div class="flex justify-center">
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside border border-text/10 rounded-xl p-4 px-8">
        <li>2x Guardian Jewel</li>
        <li>3x Tenderizer Jewel</li>
        <li>3x Critical Jewel</li>
        <li>2x Attack Jewel</li>
        <li>2x Expert Jewel</li>
        <li>3x Sharp Jewel</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>
      Beyond the main story, High Rank offers plenty more challenges. As you increase your HR level,
      you'll unlock new quests featuring powerful Elder Dragons and Apex Monsters, each bringing
      unique armor sets and weapons to craft. Whether you choose to tackle Master Rank immediately
      or explore all High Rank has to offer is up to you!
    </p>

    <NavigationButton href="/rise/guides/master-rank" text="Next: Master Rank Guide" />

    <p>
      For our final High Rank progression set, we'll craft the ultimate version of the Diablos
      Lance, boasting both impressive raw damage and respectable sharpness. To complement it, we'll
      need to farm materials for several crucial decorations. Having these decorations crafted now
      will make your early Master Rank experience much smoother.

  <Section title="High Rank Endgame - HR 100+🎖️">
    <p>
      Welcome to the pinnacle of High Rank! These endgame builds all feature Guard 3 for comfortable
      play, though veteran hunters can check out the Guard 0 builds in the linked album for maximum
      damage potential.
    </p>

    <ExternalLinkButton

    <p>
      We'll explore two distinct build paths. The first utilizes Valstrax's Dragonheart skill, which
      provides massive damage bonuses when below 80% health. While this is unquestionably the
      strongest option for experienced hunters, it requires careful health management. For those
      preferring a more comfortable playstyle, we also have a reliable build that trades a bit of
      damage for consistency.
    </p>

    <p>
      Both builds utilize the final upgrade of the Tigrex Lance, available after defeating Valstrax.
      Its white sharpness makes it slightly stronger than our trusty Diablos Lance, providing the
      perfect weapon for the endgame.
