      After completing the story, we want to reach Master Rank 10 as fast as possible. This is where
      we unlock most of the endgame content. We finally get access to anomaly research and new
      monsters.

      At MR10 we get an introduction to Anomaly Investigations. They are pretty much random quests
      that have Afflicted Monsters as the main target. Afflicted Monsters are stronger and a lot
      tankier than their regular counterparts. They also drop afflicted materials which are used to
      craft Decorations, augment weapons and armor. There's an Anomaly Rank, we call it AR, which
      you need to level up to unlock higher level materials. To check what material you get from
      what monster and at which level, you can check the Anomaly Material Page:

      To unlock higher level materials we need to level up our Anomaly Rank. This is done by
      completing Anomaly Investigations.
