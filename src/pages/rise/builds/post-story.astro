    <p>
      After completing the story, we want to reach Master Rank 10 as fast as possible. This is where
      most of the endgame content unlocks, including Anomaly Research and new powerful monsters.
    </p>
  </Section>

  <Section title="New & Old Monsters - MR10🎖️">
    <p>
      At MR10 we get our first taste of Anomaly Investigations. These are basically random quests
      with Afflicted Monsters as targets. Afflicted Monsters hit harder and have way more health
      than normal ones. They drop special materials used for crafting Decorations and augmenting
      both weapons and armor. There's also an Anomaly Rank (AR) that you need to level up to unlock
      better materials. Check out this page to see what materials you get from which monster and at
      what level:
    </p>

    <NavigationButton href="/rise/anomaly-materials" text="Anomaly Materials" emoji="🔍" />

    <p>
      We also unlock a bunch of new monsters. Some like Amatsu or Primordial Malzeno were added in
      later updates, I'd recommend avoiding these for now even if they're available.
    </p>

    <p>The monsters we want to focus on first are:</p>

    <StyledList
      items={[
        {
          text: "Violet Mizutsune: A new explosive subspecies of Mizutsune. His boots are amazing and we'll use them for a long time.",
        },
        {
          text: "Chaotic Gore Magala: After beating it you unlock Aurora Melding which guarantees one skill on your charm. Use this to get a Critical Eye 3 charm with at least a level 2 slot. Its chest piece is also one of the best we'll get.",
        },
        {
          text: 'Velkhana: The returning Iceborne flagship is a bit tougher but gives us a solid upgrade over our Lunagaron Lance.',
        },
      ]}
    />

    <p>
      For this build we also need a Chain Jewel to add Burst. It's a great skill that boosts Raw and
      Element damage when you hit the monster repeatedly. Craft it using Violet Mizutsune parts and
      a Sovereign Jewel from 1★ Anomaly Investigations.
    </p>

    <BuildCard
      build={{
        title: "Velkhana's Might",

  </Section>

  <Section title="The Anomaly Research Begins - AR71+🎖️">
    <p>
      After getting our first post-story set built, we want to focus on Anomaly Investigations. The
      goal is to hit AR70 as fast as possible since that unlocks materials for Handicraft+4 and
      Mastery+4 jewels. These decorations help free up space in our builds.
    </p>

    <p>We'll also start augmenting our weapons. For now we just want the first attack augment.</p>

    <p>
      Armor Augments become available with Anomaly Materials and they're super powerful - you can
      get almost any skill on any armor piece. The downside? It's completely random what you get,
      which can be pretty frustrating. For now we'll avoid relying on them for Core Skills. One
      easy-to-get augment though is a slot upgrade on the Teostra Crown, making it a really solid
      piece.
    </p>

        },
      ]}
    />

    <p>
      For the coil we want the Buff Body piece from Hazard Rajang. It's a great piece we'll use for
      ages, and with our Ice Lance it shouldn't be too hard to farm.

  <Section title="Kaktus My Beloved - [MR110/AR71+]🎖️">
    <p>
      At MR110 we finally unlock Risen Elder Dragons. Chameleos is the first one, and his armor
      brings a game-changing skill: Buildup Boost. When you apply status effects, this skill gives a
      raw damage boost to that hit. This buff is so strong that it shapes the entire endgame raw
      meta around status weapons.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since our Velkhana Lance doesn't have status, we're switching to the MVP - the Flaming Espinas
      Lance (aka Kaktus). This thing is absolutely cracked:
    </p>

    <StyledList
      items={[
        {
          text: 'Good raw damage and high base affinity',
        },

        },
        {
          text: 'Fire element AND poison status',
        },
      ]}
    />

    <p>
      Yes, you heard right! It has hidden Poison which triggers Buildup Boost. Combine that with
      many monsters being weak to fire, and how easy it is to build around thanks to its stats, and
      you can see why this was THE meta weapon for multiple Title Updates. Even after the final
      update, it's still one of the strongest options in the game.
    </p>

    <p>We're also starting to look at Armor Augments. The two we want:</p>

    <StyledList
      items={[
        {
          text: "Bloodlust: Gives you the Frenzy Virus from Gore Magala. Hit the monster enough to cure yourself and get a 20% Affinity buff for a minute. Yes it drains health if not cured, but it's a slow drain and you heal it all back after curing.",

        {
          text: 'Mail of Hellfire: Nice to have but not crucial. On Red Scroll we get flat raw damage at the cost of defense, while Blue Scroll gives percentage element boost but lowers elemental resistance. The raw boost is heavily frontloaded, so even just level 1 is strong.',

    <p>
      At MR120 we get Risen Kushala Daora, but his armor doesn't bring anything exciting for Lance.
      The real upgrade comes at MR140 with Risen Teostra. His armor introduces Powder Mantle - a
      crazy strong skill that's going to be in all our builds from now on.
