      When starting out in Low Rank, don't get too caught up with gear choices. The crafting system
      really opens up later - right now you're working with a pretty stripped-down version where you
      can't access most of the key Core Skills or any Decorations, and the armor pieces only give
      you basic skill combinations.
    </p>

    <p>
      The nice thing is, none of this matters much. You'll blast through Low Rank in a few hours on
      your way to High Rank, where the real equipment crafting begins. Until then, focus on getting
      comfortable with your weapon's moves and learning the basic game mechanics rather than
      stressing about gear.

        This guide is based on Chef's Monster Hunter Rise progression guide. Big thanks for doing
        all the research and work to put this together üôè I've added some optimizations to account
        for the changes caused by the Expansion.

      Want an easy mode? Champion weapons and Blackbelt armor were added right before Sunbreak's
      release to help players quickly reach the expansion. They're extremely powerful and simple to
      craft, basically letting you blast through the base game without much effort.
    </p>

    <p>
      But if you want to experience Monster Hunter properly - crafting different weapons, trying out
      various armor skills, and actually hunting monsters for materials - then follow this guide.
      You'll get to enjoy what makes Monster Hunter special rather than just rushing to the end.

    <p>
      Your starting gear in Kamura is actually decent, though we'll upgrade to a few pieces of
      Hunter armor. The Hunter's Greaves are particularly strong and will serve you well through
      most of Low Rank.
    </p>

    <p>
      Start with the Iron Lance I from the Ore Tree. While we'll switch to something better soon,
      you'll eventually need this lance to craft one of the best weapons for High and Master Rank.
    </p>

    <p>
      At this stage of the game, your weapon's Raw damage is low and you have limited skill options.
      Attack Boost is your best bet for increasing damage output, so we'll mix armor pieces that
      give Attack Boost and Critical Eye where possible.
    </p>

      The first quest in Kamura is a great way to get your bearings and learn the basics of the
      game. It's a straightforward hunt that introduces you to the game's mechanics and rewards you
      with some useful items.
