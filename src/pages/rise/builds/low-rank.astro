    <p>
      When you're just starting out in Low Rank, don't sweat the gear choices too much. The crafting
      system is pretty limited at this point. You won't have access to most of the important Core
      Skills or any Decorations, and the armor pieces only give basic skill combinations.
    </p>

    <p>
      The good news? None of this matters much. You'll cruise through Low Rank in just a few hours
      on your way to High Rank, where the real equipment crafting begins. For now, focus on
      mastering your lance's core moveset and getting comfortable with the fundamentals of
      positioning and guarding.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here's the thing about Champion weapons and Blackbelt armor, they were added right before
      Sunbreak dropped to help players rush to the expansion. They're incredibly strong and easy to
      craft, basically letting you steamroll through the base game.
    </p>

    <p>
      So if you want to experience what makes Monster Hunter special: crafting situational gear,
      experimenting with different armor skills, and actually hunting monsters for their materials,
      then stick with this guide. Trust me, the journey is what makes Monster Hunter truly
      memorable, not just racing to the endgame.

  <Section title="Welcome To Kamura Village - 1⭐">
    <p>
      Your starting Kamura gear is surprisingly solid, though we'll grab a few pieces of Hunter
      armor to improve it. The Hunter's Greaves in particular are a standout piece that'll serve you
      well through most of Low Rank.
    </p>

    <p>
      Start by crafting the Iron Lance I from the Ore Tree. While we'll switch to something better
      soon, you'll eventually need this lance for crafting one of the best weapons available in High
      and Master Rank, so it's a good investment.

      After taking down your first large monster, the Great Izuchi, you'll unlock two-star quests.
      Use its materials to craft the Wind Thief Lance I - your first weapon with green sharpness,
      which is a significant upgrade. The Great Izuchi helm is also worth crafting for some extra
      offensive power.

    <p>
      Once you've dealt with Aknosom in the Urgent Quest, you'll unlock three-star village quests,
      opening up a bunch of new hunts and monsters. After completing two Key Quests, you'll also get
      your first taste of Rampage quests :)
    </p>

    <p>
      The Sandy Plains is now available, where you can grab some Jaggi materials for its gauntlets.
      But the real prize here is Barroth. Craft both the helm and mail to hit Attack Boost 4, which
      is a massive damage increase in Rise since it adds percentage-based boosts at level 4 and
      above.
    </p>

    <p>
      We're also going to make a quick detour to craft the Kulu Lance. The Kulu Spear I packs more
      punch than our previous lance, making the upcoming hunts smoother.
    </p>

    <p>
      Don't forget to chat with Master Utsushi to unlock the Shield Charge Switch Skill. If you can
      craft 8 different lances, you'll also unlock Instablock. It's absolutely worth the effort
      since it's one of lance's most powerful defensive tools when mastered.

      Taking down Bishaten in the Urgent Quest opens up four-star village quests. Use its materials

      The Lava Caverns are now accessible, bringing new mining points for crafting the Ingot Greaves
      which are a solid upgrade to your kit. You can also challenge Barioth for its coil, which
      rounds out our armor nicely.

  <Section title="The Wyvern Of Malice Is Here - 5⭐">
    <p>
      After conquering Magnamalo, you'll reach five-star village quests. Its materials let you craft
      the Paladin Lance I, another weapon from the Ore Tree. This one's worth investing in since
      we'll be using it for quite a while.
    </p>

    <p>
      Among the newly unlocked monsters, focus on Rathalos and Anjanath. Their parts let you craft
      the Rathalos helm and braces, plus the Anjanath coil. The Rathalos pieces are mostly
      sidegrades with better defense, but that Anjanath coil with Attack Boost 2 is a straight
      upgrade.
    </p>

    <p>
      Don't stress too much about completing the whole set though, High Rank is just around the
      corner with much better gear options.

      Reaching six-star village quests unlocks the final Special License Quest. Complete all three
      of these, and you'll fast-track your way to High Rank. You could also go through Hub Quests to
      reach High Rank, but that's definitely the scenic route.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since High Rank is so close now, I wouldn't bother crafting new gear even though you have
      access to some new monsters and materials. Save those resources since you'll need them for the
      next phase of your journey:
