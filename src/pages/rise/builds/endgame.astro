  <Section title="Final Builds [MR 160+ / AR 241+]">
    <p>
      These are the final Sunbreak End Game Builds. They make use of Fully Augmented Weapons, all
      armor pieces and the latest Decorations.
    </p>

    <p>Most of these builds share some key requirements:</p>

    <StyledList
      items={[
        {
          text: 'Full weapon augmentation with the maximum possible augment slots unlocked (AR 241+)',
        },
        {
          text: 'Access to endgame armor pieces, particularly from monsters like Risen Shagaru Magala, Primordial Malzeno, and Amatsu',
        },
        {
          text: 'All decorations, including Attack Boost+4 and Critical Eye+4 decorations',
        },
      ]}
    />

    <p>
      The core design philosophy for these builds focuses on maximizing damage while maintaining
      comfort and consistency.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="Sharpness Management: Heaven-Sent vs Master's Touch" />

    <p>
      A key decision for any Lance build is how to handle sharpness management. We have two main
      approaches.
    </p>

    <p>
      Heaven-Sent is the newer option, offering infinite sharpness and stamina while active. The
      skill triggers after avoiding knockback for a short period and remains until you get knocked
      back. Important notes:
    </p>

    <StyledList
      items={[
        {
          text: "Taking chip or getting hit with Intrepid Heart up doesn\'t count as getting Knocked Back and won\'t deactivate the skill'",
        },
        {
          text: 'The infinite stamina enables Maximum Might for affinity',
        },
        {
          text: "More consistent than Master's Touch but locks you into the three Amatsu armor pieces",
        },
        {
          text: 'When you do take a solid hit, you completely lose sharpness management until the skill reactivates',
        },
      ]}
    />

    <p>
      Master's Touch is the traditional approach, preventing sharpness loss on critical hits. This
      offers:
    </p>
    <StyledList
      items={[
        {
          text: 'More flexible armor choices',
        },
        {
          text: 'Consistent sharpness management even when taking hits',
        },
        {
          text: 'Can potentially fit more damage skills',
        },
        {
          text: 'Requires managing sharpness during long hunts',
        },
      ]}
    />

    <p>
      For most players, the choice comes down to playstyle and monster matchup. Heaven-Sent excels
      in fights where you can maintain good positioning and avoid direct hits, while Master's Touch
      provides more consistent performance across all situations. I tend to favor Heaven-Sent for
      monsters because it's more comfortable to play and I have the one shot protection for the
      cases where I do get hit.
    </p>
  </Section>

  <Section title="Raw Meta" emoji="🔰">
    <p>
      Raw builds are the foundation of endgame Lance play, offering consistent damage across all
      matchups. The endgame raw meta revolves around two options: A full raw blast build or the good
      old Kaktus build.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Heaven-Sent Bazel build represents the highest potential raw damage in ideal conditions.
      By leveraging Maximum Might with Heaven-Sent's infinite stamina, we can overcome the weapon's
      negative affinity while maintaining its incredible raw damage. However, this build demands
      more precise play since losing Heaven-Sent means a significant drop in both sharpness and
      affinity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Meanwhile, the Kaktus Lance builds offer more consistency and flexibility. The weapon's
      natural affinity and purple sharpness make it perfect for Master's Touch setups, and its
      combination of fire element and poison status means it can actually outperform Bazel against
      monsters with even modest fire weaknesses (10+ fire hitzone).
    </p>

    <p>
      Choosing between Heaven-Sent and Master's Touch comes down to your comfort level and the
      specific hunt. Master's Touch builds maintain consistent performance even when taking hits,
      while Heaven-Sent offers higher peaks but requires better play to maintain its buffs. buffs.

      Elemental builds in Sunbreak endgame come in three distinct flavors: comfy Heaven-sent builds,
      consistent Master's Touch builds, and the high-risk-high-reward Dereliction builds. While
      Dereliction enables the highest elemental damage output through Strife, it comes with a
      constant health drain that requires careful management.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you're not comfortable with Dereliction's health drain, both Heaven-sent and Master's Touch
      offer strong alternatives. Master's Touch builds gain Blood Awakening which can provide higher
      damage peaks in matchups where you can consistently break parts. However, Heaven-sent builds
      tend to be more consistent overall and offer the comfort of infinite sharpness.
    </p>

    <p>
      One important note: Elemental builds heavily rely on Leaping Thrust as your main damage
      dealer. When fighting monsters with good elemental hitzones (25+ preferred), these builds can
      significantly outperform raw builds. Guard Dash into Leaping Thrust should be your go-to combo
      for maximizing elemental damage output.

      While these builds might not top the DPS charts, they offer unique and entertaining playstyles
      that can spice up your hunting experience. Each build focuses on a specific gimmick or
      mechanic that changes how you approach fights. While not optimal for speedruns, they're
      perfectly viable for regular hunts and can be surprisingly effective in the right situations.
