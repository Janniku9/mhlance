      Palamutes are a game-changer in Rise's hunting system. These combat-focused companions can
      contribute up to 30% of a monster's total HP in optimal setups, making them especially potent
      with fast-hitting weapons like Lance. While Palicos offer great utility through buffs and
      support abilities, double Palamute setups have become the go-to for pure damage output.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you're not chasing speedrun times, a Fighter Palico (for Affinity buffs and extra Wirebugs)
      or Gathering Palico (for rare material farming) paired with a Palamute offers a solid balance
      of damage and utility.
    </p>
  </Section>

  <Section title="Why are the chains so strong?">
    <p>
      With the silkbinder gun dog nerf and the chain buff in Title Update 3, the optimal palamute
      setup changed. The current meta revolves around Melee-centric builds utilizing Dual-bladed
      Chains, offering even higher damage potential through their unique mechanics.
    </p>

    >
      This clip demonstrates the powerful synergy between Lance's Anchor Rage and Palamute chain
      attacks. The successful counter triggers an immediate Whirlwind Spin from both Palamutes.
    </GifCard>

    <SectionSubTitle title="Weapon Synergy" />
    <p>
      Palamute attack patterns closely mirror hunter actions, fast-hitting weapons like Lance
      benefit tremendously from this mechanic, as each successful counter or offensive move can
      trigger companion attacks. In contrast, slower weapons like Greatsword see reduced Palamute
      damage output due to lower attack frequency.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Whirlwind Spin Attack is by far the most damaging move in the Palamute arsenal. This op
      move can be triggered by specific hunter actions across various weapon types:

        },
      ]}
    />

    <p>
      Many speedrunners now prioritize moves that trigger the Palamute spins, even if these moves
      aren't typically optimal for pure hunter DPS.
    </p>

  <Section title="How to Activate The Chains">
    <p>
      Getting your Palamutes to use their chains quickly can make a big difference in hunt times.
      There are several ways to trigger the chains, and knowing these helps you start dealing good
      damage right from the start of a hunt.
    </p>

    <StyledList
      items={[
        {
          text: 'Status effects like Paralysis, Sleep, Stun or Poison will trigger the chains',
          emoji: '💫',
        },
        {
          text: 'Using Shock or Pitfall traps works great for activation',
          emoji: '🪤',
        },
        {
          text: 'Flash bombs or Dung bombs will make them pull out the chains',
          emoji: '💡',
        },
        {
          text: 'Using elemental beetles (fire/water/thunder/ice) on the monster triggers chain attacks',
          emoji: '🐛',
        },
      ]}
    />

    <p>
      This is why you'll often see speedrunners start their hunts with a flash bomb or trap. These
      quick triggers get your Palamutes dealing high damage right away. Elemental beetles are
      especially handy since you can find them around the map and they're quick to use.

  <Section title="Best Palamute Equipment">
    <p>Let's look at what gear your Palamutes should use to deal the most damage.</p>

    <ImageGridCard
      title="Best Palamute Gear"
      maxCols={2}
      maxWidth="350px"
      images={[
        {
          src: chains,
          alt: 'Dual-bladed Chains',
          title: 'Dual-bladed Chains',
        },
        {
          src: healing,
          alt: 'Healing Blade Scroll',
          title: 'Healing Blade Scroll',
        },
      ]}
    >
      The Dual-bladed Chains are your main damage dealer, while the Healing Blade Scroll keeps both
      you and your dogs healthy during fights.
    </ImageGridCard>

    <p>
      The Dual-bladed Chains are the best dps option. For the second slot, I recommend the Healing
      Blade Scroll. It helps in two ways:
    </p>

    <StyledList
      items={[
        {
          text: 'Heals everyone nearby, including you, which means less time using potions',
          emoji: '💚',
        },
        {
          text: 'Keeps your Palamutes healthy so they spend more time attacking and less time healing themselves',
          emoji: '⚔️',
        },
      ]}
    />

    <p>
      This becomes really important in higher-level hunts where monsters hit harder. Without healing
      support, your Palamutes might spend too much time trying to heal instead of helping you deal
      damage. The free healing also means you can stay aggressive instead of backing off to use
      potions.
    </p>
  </Section>

  <Section title="Palamute Skills">
    <p>
      Your Palamutes have 8 skill slots, and four of these should always be filled with core skills.
      Melee-Centric boosts your dog's physical attacks, Counter and Artful Dodger help them stay
      alive and fighting, and either Element Attack Up or Status Attack Up rounds out the core build
      depending on what weapon they're using.
    </p>

        {

          title: 'Status',
        },
      ]}
    >
      The element build (left) focuses on raw damage with element boost, while the status build
      (right) trades some damage for status effects.
    </ImageGridCard>

    <p>
      Some monsters matchups benefit from having specific defensive skills. If you're using a Water
      Palamute against Magnamalo, Deflagration Relief is worth considering, it stops your dog from
      jumping around with hellfire, keeping them in the fight. Similarly, when facing monsters like
      Chameleos or Gold Rathian with your Fire, Thunder, or Ice dogs, Negate Poison can help
      maintain consistent damage instead of having them waste time rolling around trying to cure
      poison.
    </p>
  </Section>

  <Section title="Palamute Weapons">
    <p>
      The best way to get good damage from your Palamutes is to match their weapon's element to what
      the monster is weak to. While this means you'll need to swap weapons often, the damage boost
      is worth it. (I personally have 10 dogs, 2 for each element)
    </p>

    <p>
      Here's something interesting: even monsters that seem resistant to elements often have weak
      spots on their legs. Since Palamutes mostly attack the legs, they can deal great elemental
      damage even when you wouldn't expect it. For example, Mizutsune's claws are weak to Thunder,
      Valstrax's legs are weak to Water, and Scorned Magnamalo's back legs are weak to Water.
    </p>

    />

    <p>
      If you don't want to swap weapons all the time, status weapons are a good alternative. They do
      less damage overall, but they work well against most monsters and can help create openings for
      your team.
