    <h1>Switch Skills</h1>

    <p>
      Switch Skills add a significant amount of depth to Lance. Depending on which skills you choose
      you can change the playstyle of Lance drastically. In this Guide I will go over all the Switch
      Skills and explain what they do and how they work. I will also give my opinion on which Switch
      Skills are the best and which ones are not worth using.
    </p>
  </Section>

  <Section title="Normal Guard Vs Instablock (IB)">
    <p>
      Instablock is a straight upgrade to normal guarding in almost all situations. It has the same
      startup as Normal Guard but with the added benefit of being able to completely negate all Chip
      Damage and Knockback if you press it right before you get hit. On a successful parry you get
      access to one of lance's highest damaging moves: the Cross Slash.
    </p>

    <p>
      there are also many other options you can perform after a successful Instablock. For example
      you can Instablock again to Counter chain Attacks, or use one of your Switch Skill moves like
      Anchor Rage or Spiral Thrust.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you press the Guard button too early you end up doing a Normal Guard instead, meaning you
      aren't getting punished for pressing it too early at all. So what's the downside of running
      Instablock? Well certain Attacks have multihits that are hard to block using Instablock
      because you have to time the parry for every hit. Mastering the timing for these Attacks can
      be very difficult but it's the most satisfying feeling in the game when you finally get it
      down.
    </p>
  </Section>

  <Section title="Dash Attack Vs Shield Charge">
    <p>
      Dash Attack is the iconic Lance charge known from older games like Monster Hunter World. It
      let's you charge forwards until your Stamina runs out and is therefore really good to close
      the distance to the monster. You can also cancel The Dash with a strong finisher attack that
      deals a lot of Damage.
    </p>

    <p>
      Shield Charge on the other hand is very different. It only lets you dash a short fixed
      distance but since you are holding up your shield during the charge you can block incoming
      Attacks. Additionally you can cancel the charge into the strong finishing thrust as well as a
      shield bash that deals a lot of KO Damage.
    </p>

    <p>
      Both of these moves are pretty good and honestly it just comes down to Personal Preference.
      Are you looking for a move that let's you close Long Distances or would you rather be able to
      run through Attacks with your shield out while also having access to one of the best KO
      buildup Attacks?
    </p>
  </Section>

  <Section title="Guard Dash Vs Shield Tackle">
    <p>
      Guard Dash as well as Shield Tackle are very good moves that have it's own advantages and
      disadvantages. So it all comes down to Personal Preference. For elemental Lance Guard Dash is
      pretty much a requirement though because of it's easy access to Leaping Thrust.
    </p>

    <p>
      Both moves can be used to block fast incoming Attacks. They also both have built in Knockback
      reduction equal to the armor skill Guard level 2. Which means you can Guard Dash or Shield
      Tackle Attacks that would normally knock you back without getting Knocked Back at all.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="Guard Dash" />
    <p>
      Guard Dash gives you easy access to Leaping Thrust which is one of lance's best Dps Moves. The
      move itself has a long window where you block incoming Damage. Use it to block Attacks that
      are difficult or too fast to block with Instablock and follow up with Leaping Thrust.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Teostra does his spin attack you can Guard Dash the first paw swipe, follow up with a
      Leaping Thrust and then Guard Dash the second paw swipe. Follow up with Anchor Rage or Hop
      Instablock to block the spin attack.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="Shield Tackle" />
    <p>
      By using Shield Tackle you lose easy access to lance's best Dps Move the Leaping Thrust.
      Instead you get a very fast block that can turn you into Any Direction. The move also deals
      blunt and KO Damage and puts you into Neutral State. Being in Neutral State is really good
      because it means you can Instablock right out of Shield Tackle. After Guard dashing you won't
      be in neutral so you have less follow up options.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the clip above we can see how we use Shield Tackle to block the first punch from Rajang
      while also repositioning ourselves to the side. Because Shield Tackle leaves us in Neutral
      State we are able to follow up with an Instablock on the second punch.
    </p>
  </Section>

  <Section title="Anchor Rage Vs Spiral Thrust Vs Skyward Thrust">
    <SectionSubTitle title="Anchor Rage" />
    <p>
      Anchor Rage is a very flexible move that can be used against all monsters. It costs 1 Wirebug
      and enters you into a Counter state that blocks the next attack and follows up with a strong
      Poke. You will also receive a Raw Buff whose strength depends on the power of the attack you
      blocked. The buff lasts for 30 seconds or until you sheathe your weapon.
    </p>

    <p>The buff can be determined by the color of the glow around your weapon:</p>

    <StyledList
      items={[
        {
          text: 'Red: 5%',
          emoji: 'ðŸ”´',
        },
        {
          text: 'Orange: 10%',
          emoji: 'ðŸŸ ',
        },
        {
          text: 'Yellow: 15%',
          emoji: 'ðŸŸ¡',
        },
      ]}
    />

    <p>
      Similar to Instablock you will also receive no Chip Damage and Knockback, but unlike
      Instablock you don't have to be in Neutral State to perform this move, which makes it a really
      good panic option. The only problem is if the incoming attack consists of more than one hit.
      In that case you will be locked into the animation and most likely get hit.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="Spiral Thrust" />
    <p>
      Spiral Thrust costs 1 Wirebug and let's the hunter perform two dashes into Any Direction. The
      startup of the first dash has a built in Guard Point that let's you block incoming Attacks. If
      you successfully block an Attacks your Lance will start glowing blue for 10 seconds giving you
      a 10% Raw Buff.
    </p>

    <p>
      The two dashes both have hitboxes that have 50MV and 80MV respectively. After the second dash
      you can follow up with a strong Finishing Attack that has a impressive 90MV. Most people don't
      know about this follow up and as you can see it's by far the strongest hit of the Combo. So
      make sure to not forget about it.
    </p>

    <p>
      In theory, if you manage to land all 3 hits on the monster's Weakspot, Spiral Thrust is one of
      the best Dps Moves Lance offers. In practice this turns out the surprisingly difficult though.
      Therefore many people prefer Anchor Rage with it's more consistent high Raw Buff.
    </p>

    <p>It's still a lot of fun to use so I would recommend trying it out for yourself.</p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="Skyward Thrust" />
    <p>
      Skyward Thrust is a very flashy looking move. It costs 1 Wirebug and let's you fly into the
      sky and perform a strong diving attack that can Pierce The Monster.
    </p>

    <p>
      The upwards move deals only 40MV. The downwards move on the other hand can Tick 1-3 Times
      depending on the monster's size. Each tick deals 80MV, so at max ticks that's an impressive
      240MV. When landing there's an additional small hit that deals 30MV.
    </p>

    <p>
      This makes Skyward Thrust the strongest move Lance has to offer. The problem is just that it
      doesn't work on all monsters. But on the monsters it does work on it's a lot of fun to use.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here's a list of some monsters that have easy skyward opening: Chameleos enrage + risen
      transform + body slam, Malzeno roar, Rathian flip, Narwa sac topple, Valstrax inhale + all
      wing slams, Bazelgeuse roar ...
    </p>

    <p>
      The list goes on and on. I personally just keep it equipped on my Secondary Scroll and just
      switch to it when I see an easy opening.
    </p>
  </Section>

  <Section title="Twin Vine Vs Sheathing Retreat">
    <p>
      Twin Vine and Sheathing Retreat are both very good moves that have their own advantages and
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="Twin Vine" />
    <p>
      Twin Vine costs 1 Wirebug and let's you stab your kunai into the monster. On a hit you will be
      connected to the monster with a Silkbind Wire. You can then press the roll button to pull
      yourself towards the monster. Addiionally as long as the wire is connected you will receive
      Knockback reduction equal to the armor skill Guard Level 3.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my opinion this move is pretty bad. There's not really a reason to use it when there's many
      better gap closers like Dash Attack, Shield Charge, Guard Dash, Spiral Thrust or even
      Sheathing Retreat. The extra Knockback recution is nice but it's super conditional and the
      wire breaks easily so it's just better to slot more Guard in your set if you want more
      Knockback reduction.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="Sheathing Retreat" />
    <p>
      Sheathing Retreat costs 1 Wirebug as well and let's you sheathe your weapon immediately while
      also performing a jump backwards. Getting you out of Potentially Dangerous Situations.
    </p>

    <p>
      The move also has 40 iframes (@60 fps) on it's start up. Letting you evade Attacks that are
      difficult or impossible to block. For example if you time it with flaming Espinas stomp you
      can completely evade his nova, or you can evade rajang's lightning beam.
    </p>

    <p>
      It can also be used as a Gap Closer by turning around first, then sheathing retreating +
      buffering a mid air jump. Or you can use it to quickly access certain items mid air like flash
      Bombs. Overall it's a really good move that offers a lot of Utility and is definitely worth
      using.
