      Lance's Switch Skills offer incredible depth and versatility, allowing hunters to drastically
      alter their playstyle based on preferences and situation. This guide breaks down each Switch
      Skill, explaining their mechanics and optimal usage to help choose the best options for
      different hunting scenarios.
    </p>
  </Section>

  <Section title="Normal Guard Vs Instablock (IB)">
    <p>
      Instablock is one of lance's most powerful defensive tools and a direct upgrade to Normal
      Guard in almost every situation. While it shares the same startup as Normal Guard, landing a
      perfect parry (pressing guard right before an attack hits) completely negates chip damage and
      knockback. A successful parry grants access to Cross Slash: one of lance's highest damage
      punish options.
    </p>

    <p>
      The versatility of Instablock makes it exceptional. After a successful parry, hunters can
      chain into another Instablock to counter multiple attacks, or transition into other Switch
      Skills like Anchor Rage or Spiral Thrust for devastating follow-ups.
    </p>

      This clip showcases one of Instablock's most satisfying applications, chaining multiple
      parries against Lucent Nargacuga's triple tail slam. Each parry requires precise timing, but
      this way you can block all attacks without taking chip damage with low guard skill
      investments.
    </GifCard>

    <p>
      The risk-reward balance is surprisingly forgiving, pressing guard too early just results in a
      Normal Guard rather than leaving the hunter vulnerable. The main challenge comes from
      multi-hit attacks that require precise timing for each hit. While mastering these timings can
      be demanding, successfully pulling off an Instablock chain against rapid attacks is one of the
      most satisfying achievements in Monster Hunter.
    </p>

  <Section title="Dash Attack Vs Shield Charge">
    <p>
      Dash Attack is the classic lance charge that veterans will recognize from previous games. It
      lets hunters maintain forward momentum until stamina runs out, making it excellent for closing
      large distances. The strong finishing thrust packs serious damage when ending the charge with
      impact.
    </p>

    <p>
      Shield Charge offers a different approach, trading extended dash distance for defensive
      utility. While the charge distance is fixed, the guard remains active throughout the
      animation. This defensive charge can be canceled into either a powerful thrust or a shield
      bash that deals significant KO damage.
    </p>

    >
      This example demonstrates Shield Charge's unique strength: the ability to block while charging
      lets hunters power through attacks that would normally stop them cold. Notice how the Shield
      Charge not only blocks Diablos's charge but counters with KO damage, winning the head-to-head
      clash.
    </GifCard>

    <p>
      Both options are highly effective, and the choice depends on hunting style. Consider whether
      the situation calls for mobility and distance coverage of Dash Attack, or Shield Charge's
      ability to maintain offensive pressure while blocking through attacks.
    </p>
  </Section>

  <Section title="Guard Dash Vs Shield Tackle">
    <p>
      Both Guard Dash and Shield Tackle serve as exceptional defensive options with distinct
      advantages. These moves come with built-in knockback reduction equivalent to Guard Level 2,
      allowing hunters to block attacks that would normally cause significant pushback. For
      elemental lance builds, Guard Dash becomes particularly crucial due to its seamless access to
      Leaping Thrust.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="Guard Dash" />
    <p>
      Guard Dash excels at providing access to Leaping Thrust, one of lance's most potent DPS moves.
      The extended blocking window makes it perfect for defending against attacks that prove too
      fast or complex for Instablock timing.
    </p>

    <GifCard src="https://giphy.com/embed/1cVeuVPmfBwkgcyWm2" title="Guard Dash Weaving">
      The Teostra clip demonstrates good Guard Dash usage, blocking the initial paw swipe, following
      up with Leaping Thrust, then Guard Dashing the second swipe. This creates a perfect setup for
      either Anchor Rage or a Hop Instablock to counter the spin attack.
    </GifCard>

    <p>
      This defensive maneuver particularly shines against monsters with predictable attack patterns,
      allowing hunters to maintain aggressive positioning while staying protected.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="Shield Tackle" />
    <p>
      Shield Tackle trades the easy access to Leaping Thrust for a faster, more versatile block that
      can redirect in any direction. The move deals KO damage and returns the hunter to a neutral
      state, a crucial advantage that enables immediate follow-up Instablocks.
    </p>

      title="Shield Tackle's Quick Punish"
      reversed
    >
      Against Rajang's rapid attacks, Shield Tackle demonstrates its unique strength. The quick
      repositioning block followed by an Instablock creates punish opportunities that would be
      impossible with Guard Dash's longer animation commitment.
    </GifCard>

    <p>
      The neutral state advantage cannot be overstated, it opens up significantly more follow-up
      options compared to Guard Dash's more limited recovery options.
    </p>
  </Section>

  <Section title="Anchor Rage Vs Spiral Thrust Vs Skyward Thrust">
    <SectionSubTitle title="Anchor Rage" />
    <p>
      Anchor Rage stands out as an extremely versatile single-wirebug move that fits into any lance
      playstyle. The counter state blocks incoming attacks and follows up with a powerful thrust
      while granting a raw attack buff based on the blocked attack's strength. This buff persists
      for 30 seconds or until weapon sheathing.
    </p>

    <p>The buff can be determined by the color of the glow around your weapon:</p>

    />

    <GifCard src="https://giphy.com/embed/Uwt6bGdTm09gRLisaD" title="Anchor Rage Counter-Chain">
      This Nargacuga example showcases Anchor Rage's value as a defensive option, enabling a Cross
      Slash punish on the first tail attack by having Anchor Rage ready for the second. It's the
      only defensive move quick enough to create this punish window, allowing counterplay against
      both attacks.
    </GifCard>

    <p>
      Unlike Instablock, Anchor Rage can be performed from any state, making it an excellent panic
      option. The main limitation comes from multi-hit attacks that can catch hunters in the
      follow-up animation.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="Spiral Thrust" />
    <p>
      Spiral Thrust costs one wirebug and enables two directional dashes with significant offensive
      potential. The initial dash includes a Guard Point, and successful blocks trigger a 10-second
      blue glow indicating a 10% raw attack boost.
    </p>

    <GifCard src="https://giphy.com/embed/DPl5DdaeiBTbyCpWL1" title="Dash! Dash! Poke!" reversed>
      The clip highlights the move's devastating final thrust, strong enough to break Valstrax's
      chests. Many hunters overlook this crucial finisher, but it's essential for maximizing the
      move's damage potential.
    </GifCard>

    <p>The attack sequence carries impressive motion values:</p>

    <StyledList
      items={[
        {
          text: 'First Dash: 50 MV',
        },
        {
          text: 'Second Dash: 80 MV',
        },
        {
          text: 'Final Thrust: 90 MV',
        },
      ]}
    />

    <p>
      While landing all hits on a weakspot theoretically offers top-tier DPS, achieving this
      consistently proves challenging in practice. Many hunters prefer Anchor Rage's more reliable
      damage boost, though Spiral Thrust's mobility and burst damage potential make it worth
      mastering.
    </p>

    <p>It's still a lot of fun to use so I would recommend trying it out for yourself.</p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="Skyward Thrust" />
    <p>
      Skyward Thrust delivers a spectacular aerial attack sequence for one wirebug. The initial
      upward thrust deals 40 MV, but the real damage comes from the diving attack that can hit
      multiple times based on monster sizem each hit dealing 80 MV for up to 240 MV total, plus a 30
      MV landing hit.
    </p>

    <GifCard src="https://giphy.com/embed/nSUmR2PIACnC1dvDT8" title="Skyward Thrust Snipe ">
      The Bazelgeuse clip demonstrates stylish Skyward Thrust usage, turning an otherwise
      unreachable target into a cool punish opportunity. While not universally applicable, it excels
      against specific monsters and moves.
    </GifCard>

    <p>Common openings include:</p>

    />

    <p>
      Many experienced hunters keep Skyward Thrust on their secondary scroll, switching to it when
      optimal opportunities arise.

  <Section title="Twin Vine Vs Sheathing Retreat">
    <p>
      Both of these single-wirebug moves serve distinct purposes in lance's toolkit, though their
      effectiveness varies significantly in practical hunting scenarios.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="Twin Vine" />
    <p>
      Twin Vine expends one wirebug to embed a kunai into the monster, creating a silkbind
      connection. While connected, hunters gain knockback reduction equivalent to Guard Level 3 and
      can quickly close distance by pressing the roll button to pull themselves toward the monster.
    </p>

    <GifCard src="https://giphy.com/embed/MdXIHUO5HQ9tjKTbLY" title="Twin Vine Aerial " reversed>
      The Rathalos clip demonstrates an ideal scenario, using Twin Vine's pull to chase down a
      flying monster and land a precise tail hit. While visually impressive, achieving consistent
      value from this move proves challenging in practice.
    </GifCard>

    <p>
      Despite its unique mechanics, Twin Vine struggles to justify its wirebug cost. The move faces
      strong competition from more reliable gap closers like Dash Attack, Shield Charge, Guard Dash,
      and even Sheathing Retreat. While the knockback reduction sounds appealing, the wire's
      fragility and situational nature make it less reliable than simply slotting Guard skills into
      the armor set.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="Sheathing Retreat" />
    <p>
      Sheathing Retreat provides an immediate weapon sheath combined with a backward leap, all for a
      single wirebug. This defensive option proves invaluable for escaping otherwise unavoidable
      situations.
    </p>

    <GifCard src="https://giphy.com/embed/pvjZSmpnAd0EIT5ytL" title="Perfect Retreat ">
      This Flaming Espinas example perfectly illustrates the move's utility, timing the retreat with
      the foot slam creates a guaranteed escape from the following explosion. This allows hunters to
      maintain an aggressive position instead of resorting to emergency diving.
    </GifCard>

    <p>
      The move's initial frames include 40 iframes (at 60 FPS), enabling evasion through attacks
      that would be impossible or extremely difficult to block. Beyond pure defense, creative
      hunters can also use it offensively:
    </p>

    <StyledList
      items={[
        {
          text: 'Turn around first, then Sheathing Retreat + buffered mid-air jump for gap closing',
        },
        {
          text: 'Quick access to items like flash bombs while airborne',
        },
        {
          text: 'Repositioning for better angles on monster weak points',
        },
      ]}
    />

    <p>
      The versatility and reliability of Sheathing Retreat make it a valuable addition to any lance
      hunter's toolkit, especially against monsters with powerful unblockable attacks.
