      Combos are the heart and soul of Monster Hunter Rise's combat system. Mastering them is
      essential for maximizing your damage output and becoming a proficient hunter. While every
      weapon has its unique combo patterns, Lance stands out with its distinctive rhythm of blocks
      and counters.

    <p>
      At its core, Lance's gameplay revolves around a simple yet elegant dance: block incoming
      attacks, then strike back with precision. Don't let this straightforward approach fool you
      though - there's incredible depth to Lance's defensive options and follow-up attacks. A
      skilled Lance user knows exactly when to counter-attack and, just as importantly, when to hold
      back to maintain defensive positioning.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rise gives Lance hunters an impressive defensive moveset to choose from:

      <StyledList
        variant="compact"
        items={[
          {
            text: 'Normal Guard: Your reliable fallback for multi-hit attacks or tricky timing windows',
            emoji: '🔰',

            emoji: '🏃‍♂️',
          },
          {
            text: 'Shield Tackle: Great for interrupting faster attacks',
            emoji: '🛡️',
          },
          {
            text: 'Spiral Thrust: Excellent counter with built-in mobility',
            emoji: '〰️',
          },
          {
            text: 'Counter Thrust: Classic counter-attack with generous timing',
            emoji: '⏪',

            emoji: '💨',
          },
        ]}
      />
    </p>

    <p>
      After successfully defending, you'll want to capitalize with your offensive options. Your
      bread-and-butter attacks are Cross Slash for general use, Charged Wide Sweep for raw damage
      builds, and Leaping Thrust for elemental setups. The key to high-level Lance play is reading
      the monster's recovery animations to know exactly how many attacks you can safely fit in.
      Sometimes you'll have time for a full Cross Slash into Charged Wide Sweep combo, while other
      openings might only allow for a quick Cross Slash or a single poke. Remember - it's better to
      land one safe hit and maintain your defensive position than to get greedy and eat a
      counter-attack.

      When a monster is toppled or immobilized, you have several powerful combo options. The
      comparison below breaks down each combo's metrics:

      alt="Combo Overview"
      caption="Comparative analysis of raw damage, element/status application, sharpness consumption, and hits per second."
      maxWidth="700px"
    />

    <p>
      Your Hit/second ratio directly impacts how quickly you can stack effects like Powder Mantle
      and Intrepid Heart, making it an consideration beyond damage.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lance requires a reset after every third attack. Using just pokes, you can reset by waiting
      (inefficient), hopping (fast but no damage), or using Guard Dash/Shield Tackle (optimal). The
      following sections detail the best combos for each reset option.
    </p>
  </Section>

  <Section title="guard dash raw combos" emoji="🏃‍♂️">
    <p>
      Guard Dash provides both defensive repositioning and access to Leaping Thrust, making it the
      optimal reset choice for most situations. The move's versatility allows for effective combo
      loops while maintaining defensive capabilities.
    </p>

    <p>
      For raw damage builds, Charged Wide Sweep delivers the highest motion values. The ideal combo
      incorporates Guard Dash and Leaping Thrust to loop CWS efficiently.
    </p>

    <ComboCard
      combo={{

          'Guard Dash Leaping Thrust is the most optimal way to loop Charged Wide Sweeps',

            ['MouseRight'],
          ],
        },
      }}
    />

    <p>
      When monster positioning makes landing Charged Wide Sweep difficult, switch to a double High
      Thrust approach. This three-attack sequence (Leaping Thrust + 2 High Thrusts) provides
      reliable damage with the added benefit of the third hit's increased damage modifier.

  <Section title="Shield Tackle Combos">
    <p>
      Without easy access to Leaping Thrust, Shield Tackle builds use different loop strategies.
      Shield Tackle provides KO potential and modest damage while serving as an effective combo
      reset tool.
    </p>

    <p>
      The optimal Shield Tackle combo incorporates as many Charged Wide Sweeps as possible within
      the three-attack limit before resetting with Shield Tackle.

          ],
        },
      }}
    />

    <p>
      For shorter openings, a simplified Shield Tackle + Charged Wide Sweep loop offers superior
      positioning flexibility, KO buildup, and sharpness efficiency at the cost of raw damage
      output.

  <Section title="Spiral Thrust Combos">

      Spiral Thrust delivers impressive raw damage when all three hits connect with a weak point.
      However, this can be challenging even against downed monsters. Additionally, using Spiral
      Thrust means giving up Anchor Rage, which provides more consistent damage bonuses over longer
      periods.
