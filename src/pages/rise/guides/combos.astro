      Combos are the heart and soul of Monster Hunter Rise's combat system. Mastering them is
      essential for maximizing your damage output and becoming a proficient hunter. While every
      weapon has its unique combo patterns, Lance stands out with its distinctive rhythm of blocks
      and counters.
    </p>

    <p>
      At its core, Lance's gameplay revolves around a simple yet elegant dance: block incoming
      attacks, then strike back with precision. Don't let this straightforward approach fool you
      though - there's incredible depth to Lance's defensive options and follow-up attacks. A
      skilled Lance user knows exactly when to counter-attack and, just as importantly, when to hold
      back to maintain defensive positioning.
    </p>

      Rise gives Lance hunters an impressive defensive moveset to choose from:

      <StyledList

          {
            text: 'Normal Guard: Your reliable fallback for multi-hit attacks or tricky timing windows',

            emoji: '🛡️',
          },

            emoji: '〰️',
          },
          {
            text: 'Counter Thrust: Classic counter-attack with generous timing',
            emoji: '⏪',
          },
          {
            text: 'Sheathing Retreat: Your escape option for unblockable attacks',
            emoji: '💨',
          },
        ]}
      />
    </p>

    <p>
      After successfully defending, you'll want to capitalize with your offensive options. Your
      bread-and-butter attacks are Cross Slash for general use, Charged Wide Sweep for raw damage
      builds, and Leaping Thrust for elemental setups. The key to high-level Lance play is reading
      the monster's recovery animations to know exactly how many attacks you can safely fit in.
      Sometimes you'll have time for a full Cross Slash into Charged Wide Sweep combo, while other
      openings might only allow for a quick Cross Slash or a single poke. Remember - it's better to
      land one safe hit and maintain your defensive position than to get greedy and eat a
      counter-attack.

      When a monster is down, paralyzed, or immobilized, you have several powerful loop options. The
      table above breaks down the main combos with their respective Raw damage, Element/Status
      application, Sharpness consumption, and Hits per second. The choice between these depends
      primarily on your build type:

        {

        },
        {
          text: 'Element/Status builds excel with Leaping Thrust only loops',
        },
        {
          text: 'For sharpness efficiency, consider CWS + ST',
        },
      ]}
    />

    <p>
      Since we'll cover the detailed execution and situational use of these combos later, just keep
      in mind that your Hit/second ratio will affect how quickly you can stack effects like Powder
      Mantle or Intrepid Heart.
