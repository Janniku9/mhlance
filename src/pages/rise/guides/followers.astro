      Monster Hunter Rise introduces an new feature: Followers. The story characters can join you on
      hunts, bringing unique weapons and skills to your team. Unlike multiplayer hunts, bringing
      Followers doesn't increase monster health, therefore speeding up your hunts if used properly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Followers help you by: Dealing consistent damage throughout the hunt, mounting and riding
      monsters when opportunities arise. Beyond just damage, they'll support you with healing items,
      and especially buffs, they can even set up traps and bombs at good moments.

      For comfortable hunting, the duo of Hinoa and Utsushi with their Hunting Horns provides an
      excellent mix of damage and support. Together, they keep you buffed with Attack Up most of the
      hunt, while providing extra defensive options and healing when needed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Utsushi focuses on offensive support. His Attack Up and Element Up songs boost your damage
      output significantly, while his Blight Negated song helps you stay aggressive against monsters
      with blights. Having these buffs without needing to slot in resistances can really free up
      your build options.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hinoa brings defensive utility without sacrificing damage. She'll play Attack Up like Utsushi,
      but adds Defense Up and healing songs to her rotation. She's particularly helpful in tough
      fights, using healing items and antidotes to keep you healthy while maintaining good damage
      output.

      This combination provides constant buffs while keeping you safe through heals and defensive

        If you're comfortable with the fight and want to speed up your hunts slightly more, swapping
        Hinoa for Luchika creates a more aggressive team. While you lose some defensive utility, you
        gain slightly more damage and cc.
      </p>

      <p>
        Luchika's Heavy Bowgun brings more damage and status effects to the table. Her trap usage is
        particularly good, creating more cc.
      </p>

      <p>
        Keeping Utsushi ensures you still have Attack Up and Element Up buffs, which help both you
        and Luchika deal more damage.
