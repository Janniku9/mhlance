      Guard Up underwent significant changes in Monster Hunter Rise. Unlike previous games where a
      single level would fully block special attacks, it now requires three levels and still lets
      through at least 20% of the attack's damage. This makes the skill much less efficient for your
      builds.

    <p>
      In the endgame especially, even with Guard Up 3, these special attacks can still hit
      devastatingly hard. Most of these powerful moves have clear telegraph animations or voice
      lines, giving you time to position yourself safely out of the way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rise also introduced more truly unblockable attacks that can't be defended against even with
      Guard Up. Given this, plus the high skill investment needed for Guard Up 3, you're usually
      better off learning each monster's tells and planning your positioning accordingly. Save those
      precious skill slots for more impactful defensive options like Guard, Intrepid Heart or
      Heaven-Sent or offensive skills that'll help you end the hunt faster.
