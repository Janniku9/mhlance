      In Monster Hunter World, the Guard Up skill allows hunters to block certain otherwise
      unblockable attacks. Unlike in Rise where the skill has three levels, World's Guard Up is a
      single-level skill that when active, lets you block all blockable special attacks with no
      additional chip damage penalty.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, it's important to note that not every attack can be blocked, even with Guard Up. Some
      attacks are truly unblockable and must be avoided entirely. Additionally, while Guard Up
      allows you to block special moves, your shield's natural blocking power (affected by the Guard
      skill) still determines how much stamina you lose and knockback you receive.
    </p>

    <p>
      For weapons with shields, understanding what can and cannot be blocked with Guard Up is
      crucial for effective defensive play. This knowledge helps you decide when to invest in Guard
      Up (through decorations or armor) and when to focus on positioning and evasion instead.
