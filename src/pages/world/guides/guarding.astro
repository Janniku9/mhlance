      Lance's identity in Monster Hunter World revolves around its exceptional defensive
      capabilities. While other weapons need to sheathe and dodge, Lance users stand their ground
      through a diverse array of guarding options. Mastering these defensive techniques is essential
      for maintaining aggressive pressure and turning monster attacks into counter-offensive
      opportunities.
    </p>

    <p>
      This guide breaks down each guarding option, explaining their mechanics, strengths, and
      optimal usage situations to help you develop an impenetrable defense against any monster.
    </p>
  </Section>

  <Section title="Guard Mechanics">
    <p>
      Before diving into specific techniques, let's understand how guarding works in Monster Hunter
      World. Each monster attack has a specific "Power Value" that determines how difficult it is to
      block.
    </p>

      Understanding knockback levels is crucial for Lance mastery. This comparison shows how
      different guard levels affect your ability to maintain offensive pressure after blocking.

    <SectionSubTitle title="Guard Thresholds" />

    <StyledList
      variant="compact"
      items={[
        {
          text: 'Guard 1 increases threshold to 50',
          emoji: '🛡️',
        },
        {
          text: 'Guard 3 increases threshold to 60',
          emoji: '🛡️🛡️',
        },
        {
          text: 'Guard 5 increases threshold to 70',
          emoji: '🛡️🛡️🛡️',
        },
      ]}
    />

    <p>
      When blocking an attack, the game compares its Power Value to your Guard Threshold, resulting
      in three possible outcomes:
    </p>

    <StyledList
      items={[
        {
          text: 'No Knockback: Power Value < Guard Threshold. No chip damage, minimal stamina cost, immediate follow-up possible.',
          emoji: '✅',
        },
        {
          text: 'Medium Knockback: Guard Threshold ≤ Power Value < (Guard Threshold + 10). 10% chip damage, moderate stamina cost, brief recovery animation.',
          emoji: '⚠️',
        },
        {
          text: 'Heavy Knockback: Power Value ≥ (Guard Threshold + 10). 20% chip damage, high stamina cost, lengthy recovery animation.',
          emoji: '❌',
        },
      ]}
    />

    <p>
      Higher Guard skill levels let you comfortably block stronger attacks, reducing both chip
      damage and stamina consumption. For most hunts, Guard 3 offers an excellent balance between
      investment and protection, while Guard 5 is worth considering for particularly hard-hitting
      monsters.
    </p>
  </Section>

  <Section title="Counter Thrust">
    <p>
      Counter Thrust is your bread-and-butter defensive response, transforming incoming attacks into
      immediate offensive opportunities. Perform it by pressing Guard + High Poke simultaneously,
      creating a brief counter window that, when triggered by an attack, automatically follows with
      a powerful thrust.
    </p>

    <p>
      This Counter is your Bread And Butter Block you want to use most of the time when fighting a
      monster. It's very fast and low commitment. You mostly want to input as many pokes as you can
      before the monster Attacks and then Counter. It's gonna look something like this: Poke, Poke,
      Poke, Counter, Poke, Counter, etc.
    </p>

      alt="CT example"
      width="720px"
      reversed
    >
      Against precision attacks like Alatreon's elemental strikes, Counter Thrust allows you to
      maintain an aggressive rhythm of pokes and counters. Notice how each successful counter
      creates an immediate opening for additional damage.
    </GifCard>

    <p>
      This move excels in creating a rhythm of continuous offense: Poke, Poke, Poke, Counter, Poke,
      Counter. When executed successfully against an attack, you can even chain directly into
      another Counter Thrust for consecutive hits.
    </p>

    <p>
      The technique's main limitation is that Heavy Knockback attacks will prevent the follow-up
      thrust. However, as we'll cover later, Power Guard can help overcome this limitation.
    </p>
  </Section>

  <Section title="Guard Dash">
    <p>
      Guard Dash provides controlled mobility while maintaining defensive protection. Perform it by
      pressing Guard + Low Poke, allowing you to move in any direction while keeping your shield
      raised. This technique bridges the gap between offense and defense, letting you reposition
      without becoming vulnerable.
    </p>

      title="Gap closing while blocking with Guard Dash"
      alt="guard dash"
      width="720px"
    >
      This clip demonstrates ideal Guard Dash usage: closing distance while defensively handling a
      roar. This technique shines when you need controlled movement without sacrificing protection.
    </GifCard>

    <p>While Guard Dash is powerful for repositioning, it has some limitations:</p>

    <StyledList
      variant="compact"
      items={[
        {
          text: 'Heavy Knockback will stop the dash completely',
        },
        {
          text: 'Follow-up attacks (Leaping Thrust/Shield Bash) are weaker in World compared to Rise',
        },
        {
          text: 'To dash backward or sideways from neutral position, you must first aim with the slinger',
        },
      ]}
    />

    <p>
      Guard Dash is most effective for closing short distances while maintaining defense,
      particularly when you anticipate an incoming attack. For unobstructed mobility, the standard
      dash attack is often more efficient.
    </p>
  </Section>

  <Section title="Power Guard">
    <p>
      Power Guard represents your ultimate defensive stance, trading chip damage for unparalleled
      protection and counter-attack potential. Activate it by entering Counter Thrust stance and
      pressing the hop button, creating a specialized guarding position with unique properties.
    </p>

      title="Power Guard Cancel"
      alt="pgc"
      width="720px"
      reversed

      This clip showcases Power Guard's advanced application: canceling knockback recovery
      animations into powerful counter thrusts. This technique transforms defensive disadvantage
      into offensive opportunity.
    </GifCard>

    <p>Power Guard offers several exceptional advantages:</p>

    <StyledList
      items={[
        {
          text: "360° blocking angle (vs. normal guard's 220°)",
          emoji: '🔄',
        },
        {
          text: 'Eliminates stamina loss from blocking (instead drains stamina over time)',
          emoji: '💪',
        },
        {
          text: 'Reduced knockback distance from heavy attacks',
          emoji: '🏋️',
        },
        {
          text: 'Powerful directional Counter Thrust in any direction',
          emoji: '🎯',
        },
        {
          text: 'After 1.2 seconds, grants Guard Up effect (blocks unblockable attacks)',
          emoji: '✨',
        },
      ]}
    />

    <p>
      These benefits come with one significant trade-off: Power Guard increases chip damage by 10%
      compared to Normal Guard. However, this downside is often overshadowed by allowing: knockback
      cancels, blocking stamina intensive multi-hit attacks and allowing a counter in all
      directions.
    </p>

    <p>
      For optimal efficiency, most experienced Lance users prefer to start with Counter Thrust and
      transition to Power Guard only if needed, rather than entering Power Guard directly. This
      approach minimizes chip damage while maintaining access to Power Guard's benefits.
    </p>

  <Section title="Guard Shot & Counter Claw">
    <p>
      Iceborne introduced two clutch-based defensive techniques that expand Lance's toolkit with
      unique utility: Guard Shot and Counter Claw. These options integrate the clutch claw mechanic
      with Lance's defensive identity.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="Guard Shot" />
    <p>
      Guard Shot provides quick access to slinger ammunition during defensive play. This technique
      lets you block an incoming attack and immediately follow with either a clutch claw grapple or
      slinger burst, adding ranged options to your defensive repertoire.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="Counter Claw" />
    <p>
      Counter Claw is one of Lance's most satisfying techniques, allowing you to convert a blocked
      attack directly into a clutch claw grapple. This move creates unique tenderizing and wallbang
      opportunities that would be impossible with other weapons.
    </p>

    <p>Both of these techniques are covered in depth in our dedicated Clutch Claw guide:</p>
