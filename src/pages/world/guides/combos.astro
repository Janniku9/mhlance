      In Monster Hunter World, there's a lot of different ways to lock down a monster. There's
      Wallbangs, Environmental Traps like vines and boulders, Status Effects like stun or paralysis
      that leave the monster open to attack. A lot of the monsters also have Trips or Head Topples
      that make them fall over for a few seconds. So in this section, we're gonna go over the best
      Combos you can do to maximize your Damage during these openings.

      This is a must-watch for new Lance users looking to understand the weapon's fundamentals.

      Lance's strength comes from its ability to maintain aggressive pressure while staying safe.
      During monster attacks, you'll be guarding and counter-attacking (covered in the Guard
      Mechanics section). When the monster is vulnerable - whether from trips, topples, status
      effects, or environmental traps - you'll want to maximize your damage output with the optimal
      combo for that situation.

      Your primary damage loop as a Lance user revolves around these three core combos. Each serves
      a different purpose and situation, but all maintain the Lance's signature rhythm of precise,
      controlled strikes.
    </p>

    <p>
      This Combo consists of Three Pokes followed by an Instant Canceled Dash Attack. This will give
      us one Dash Tick followed by the Finisher Hit. I would go as far as to say that this is the
      best Combo in the game. It's decently fast, does good Damage, low Sharpness consumption and
      only very slightly relies on good positioning. The reason why it's slightly positioning
      reliant is because although The Dash attack is very short, it still moves you forward a bit.
      So ideally you want to be Stuck Against the monster's head.

    <p>
      The Triple Poke Dash is your go-to combo for most situations. It delivers strong, consistent
      damage without excessive sharpness consumption. The dash is short enough to keep you on target
      while providing a fluid combo loop. This combo shines during medium-length openings like
      topples, paralyzes, and KOs.
    </p>

    <p>
      To execute this perfectly, position yourself so that the short dash keeps you in contact with
      the monster's weakpoint, usually the head. After the three pokes, perform an
      instantly-canceled Dash Attack to deliver one dash tick and a finisher hit before returning to
      pokes.

    <p>
      The Triple Poke Twin Finisher is your ultimate damage combo when you have a perfect opening.
      After your three standard pokes, perform a Charged Dash Attack, counting approximately 6 dash
      ticks (or waiting for the subtle visual charge-up) before executing the finisher. This
      delivers the powerful Twin Finisher attack instead of the standard finisher.
    </p>

    <p>
      This combo is best used during lengthy openings like wallbangs, knockdowns from mounts, or
      when a monster is trapped. Due to its long duration and positioning requirements, it's
      situational - but when executed correctly, nothing beats its raw damage output.

      }}

    <p>
      The Triple Poke Hop is your reliable fallback combo. While it has the lowest damage potential,
      it requires minimal positioning and works in virtually all situations. After three pokes, a
      quick hop resets your combo sequence, allowing you to immediately continue attacking.
    </p>

    <p>
      This combo excels during short openings, against highly mobile monsters, or when you're still
      learning the weapon. It's also valuable when a monster is about to recover or move, as the hop
      provides mobility to reposition for defense. As you gain experience, you'll naturally
      transition to the higher-damage combos, but this remains a solid option when conditions aren't
      ideal.

  <Section title="Fun Fact">
    <p>
      Here's a quirky bit of Lance trivia for the mathematically minded hunters out there! There's a
      theoretical variation of the Twin Finisher Combo that's mathematically stronger (but
      practically useless).
    </p>

    <p>
      By buffer-inputting a jump at the very start of your Dash, you can perform an aerial dash tick
      followed by ground ticks. Since aerial ticks have a higher motion value (MV 25) than normal
      dash ticks (MV 11), the math works out to:
    </p>

    <p>
      Standard dash: 6 ground ticks = 11 × 6 = 66 motion value<br />
      Jump combo: 1 ground + 1 aerial + 3 ground = 11 + 25 + (3 × 11) = 69 motion value
    </p>

    <p>
      With the Airborne skill, the aerial tick gets another 30% boost! But in reality, this combo is
      extraordinarily impractical and likely impossible to execute consistently in actual hunts.
      It's just an amusing example of how deep Lance's mechanics go beneath the surface.
    </p>

      This might be the "best" combo on paper, but you'll never see it in an actual speedrun.
