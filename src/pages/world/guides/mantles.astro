      Mantles and boosters are useful tools in Monster Hunter World that provide temporary effects
      to help during hunts. Mantles are worn over your armor, while boosters create effect zones on
      the ground. Using them at the right time can make hunts significantly easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can equip two specialized tools at a time, and they each have cooldowns between uses. This
      guide covers the most useful mantles and boosters and how to get the most out of them.

  <Section title="Best Endgame Mantles">
    <p>
      The best mantles for endgame play are the ones that offer the most utility and damage
      potential. These are especially useful when you have access to health augments and other
      late-game equipment. Here are the top picks that most hunters should consider using.
    </p>

    <MantleCard
      name="Rocksteady Mantle"
      image={rocksteadyMantle}
      description={[
        'This is probably the best mantle in the game in my opinion. Especially in the endgame. While active it prevents Knockback and reduces Damage from Attacks that hit you. You also ignore all roars, tremors and wind pressure. This allows you to pretty much Tenderize a monster for free.',
        "It's also a great way to start a fight because you can clutch on during the roar for a Wallbang or Tenderize. Afterwards you're also gonna ignore the enrage roar.",
        "The reason why it's good in the endgame is because we're gonna have Health Augments and with the Damage reduction and no Knockback we can pretty much just facetank anything and heal back up.",
      ]}
      cooldown="360s"
      duration="90s"
      effects={[
        'Prevents knockback from attacks',
        'Reduces damage taken by 30%',
        'Grants immunity to roars, tremors, and wind pressure',
        'Allows uninterrupted actions during monster attacks',
      ]}
    />

    <MantleCard
      name="Temporal Mantle"
      image={temporalMantle}
      description={[
        'The Temporal mantle automatically dodges Attacks for you. This is really powerful because it allows you to be really aggressive.',
        "The problem is that it doesn't last very long and has a long cooldown. Plus on top of that every auto dodge it performs will reduce the duration. So you can't just put it on and facetank everything.",
      ]}
      cooldown="300s"
      duration="120s"
      effects={[
        'Automatically dodges most attacks without player input',
        "Each automatic dodge reduces the mantle's remaining duration",
        'Allows for aggressive playstyle during use',
        'Great for dangerous situations or when tenderizing monster parts',
      ]}
      reversed
    />

    <MantleCard
      name="Evasion Mantle"
      image={evasionMantle}
      cooldown="300s"
      duration="90s"
      description={[
        'Even though we have a shield, the Evasion mantle is still a great tool for Lance. The reason for that is because sometimes evading an attack is just better than blocking it.',
        'The Evasion mantle is gonna make it easier to dodge while also giving us a Damage buff if we successfully do so. The slots are also really nice.',
      ]}
      effects={[
        'Increases invulnerability window during dodge rolls',
        'Provides 30% attack boost for 20 seconds after a successful dodge',
        'Comes with two level 3 decoration slots',
      ]}
    />
  </Section>

  <Section title="Best Progession Tools">
    <p>
      Before you have access to the endgame mantles, these tools will help you progress through the
      story and early investigations. They're easier to acquire and can significantly improve your
      survival until you unlock better options.
    </p>

    <MantleCard
      name="Glider Mantle"
      image={gliderMantle}
      cooldown="120s"
      duration="180s"
      description={[
        "The glider mantle is one of the better Mantles, especially in mid Master Rank. The reason for that are it's long duration (3 mins) and the slots you get in Master Rank.",
        "You can upgrade it pretty early in MR, where it's gonna get two 4 slots for Decorations. Since in mid Master Rank we don't have a lot of space for Decorations, this is a great way to get some extra skills.",
      ]}
      effects={[
        'Allows you to ride air currents for longer distances',
        'Increases mounting damage',
        'Extremely long 3-minute duration',
        'Upgrades to two level 4 decoration slots in Master Rank',

    <MantleCard
      name="Health Booster"
      image={healthBooster}
      cooldown="150s"
      duration="60s"
      description={[
        "The health booster is one of the best Tools for Lance in the early game. We can get it pretty early and it's gonna help us deal with the Chip Damage we take from blocking. So it really shines before we have Health Augments.",
        'Just place it down and stand in it when fighting a monster.',
      ]}
      effects={[
        'Creates a healing zone that regenerates health over time',
        'Great for countering chip damage from blocking',
        'Provides continuous healing throughout a fight',
        'Especially useful before acquiring Health Augments',

    <MantleCard

      cooldown="360s"
      duration="120s"
      description={[
        "The Vitality Mantle is one of the first specialized tools you'll get in Monster Hunter World. It works as a temporary buffer against damage, absorbing a set amount of damage before breaking.",
        "While not as powerful as some later mantles, it's incredibly useful in the early to mid-game and remains a reliable defensive option throughout your hunting career.",
      ]}
      effects={[
        'Absorbs a set amount of damage before breaking',
        'Provides temporary protection against large hits',
        'Available early in the game',
        'Quick cooldown compared to other defensive mantles',
      ]}
    />
  </Section>

  <Section title="Situational Mantles">
    <p>
      These mantles might not be universally useful but can be extremely effective in specific
      situations. They're worth keeping in your loadout options and swapping in when facing
      appropriate monsters or when using certain weapon types.
    </p>

    <MantleCard
      name="Impact Mantle"
      image={impactMantle}
      cooldown="210s"
      duration="90s"
      description={[
        "The Impact mantle is rather niche but still very powerful. While active your Attacks will deal stun Damage when hitting a monster's head.",
        'You can KO a lot of monsters quite easily with this, giving us free Damage windows.',
      ]}
      effects={[
        'Adds stun damage to all weapon attacks',
        'Makes it easier to KO monsters by hitting their head',
        'Creates openings for high damage combos',
        'Effective with fast-hitting weapons like Lance',

        "It's gonna reduce your status buildup by 30% but you will apply status buildup on every single attack. Usually you only apply status on every 3rd hit. So this makes it from 100% every 3rd hit to 70% every single hit. This means your status application is gonna be a lot more consistent and is also increased by a factor of 2.1",
      ]}
      effects={[
