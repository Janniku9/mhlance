    In the beginning of the game you'll be able to create your own Palico. You can bring it on solo
    or duo hunts where it will help you with dealing Damage, using supportive abilities and most
    importantly stealing your aggro. For some people the aggro stealing is a deal breaker, but if
    you love your Cat and want to bring it on your hunts here's a quick Guide on the best equipment.

    <p>
      Palico gadgets are the most impactful part of your palico's equipment. There are a lot of
      different gadgets that all have their own unique abilities. From Healing to buffing to Damage
      dealing, to Cc, there's a Gadget for pretty much everything. So here's a list of the best
      gadgets that are worth leveling up:
