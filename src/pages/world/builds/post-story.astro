    <p>
      Congratulations on defeating Shara Ishvalda! Now it's time for Iceborne's extensive endgame
      content. Your focus will be on three key areas:
    </p>

    <StyledList

  </Section>

  <Section title="Welcome To The Grinding Lands - MR 24🎖️">
    <p>
      Your first priority is assembling a strong set for efficient Guiding Lands farming and
      tackling the initial Special Assignments.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you can defeat the Frostfang Barioth event quest (available at MR24), its lance offers a
      significant upgrade over the Kulu weapon. This is the first lance with purple sharpness, and
      it comes with ice element - perfect for the upcoming monsters that are predominantly weak to
      ice.
    </p>

    <p>
      Post-story monsters hit considerably harder, making Guard 5 and Guard Up increasingly
      valuable. We'll incorporate both into our build. If you lack a Guard Up decoration, you can
      obtain one from the Elder Melder after completing the story. Since decoration collections are
      likely limited at this point, we'll use the Seething Bazelgeuse mail for efficient Guard
      levels.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fortify becomes essential in the Guiding Lands since there's no faint limit. This skill
      provides substantial damage and defense bonuses for 50 minutes after each cart, making it
      extremely valuable for extended farming sessions.
    </p>

  <Section title="The Master Of All Elements - MR 100🎖️">
    <p>
      After completing the Safi'jiiva recon, you'll unlock the Alatreon Special Assignment. This
      elder dragon presents a unique challenge with his elemental mechanics and devastating Escaton
      Judgment nova.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alatreon cycles through three forms: Fire, Ice, and Dragon. In the assignment, he begins in
      Fire Active mode where he's most vulnerable to ice. Later, he transitions to Dragon Active
      before performing his Escaton Judgment - a powerful nova that will kill you unless you've
      dealt sufficient elemental damage to weaken it. After the nova, he normally shifts to Ice
      Active, unless you break his horns during Dragon phase, which forces him back to Fire Active.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our strategy involves using an ice weapon to deal enough elemental damage for the topple while
      breaking his horns to prevent the shift to Ice Active (where our ice weapon would be
      ineffective). The Frostfang Barioth Lance strikes an ideal balance between ice element and raw
      damage - important since Alatreon's hitzones actually favor raw attacks while still requiring
      elemental damage to survive his nova.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you're struggling with the elemental threshold, consider farming for Safi or Kjarr ice
      lances, though these are random drops and may take time to obtain.
    </p>

    <p>
      Players comfortable with Alatreon's moveset and tenderizing opportunities can use our MR100
      build with the Frostfang Lance. For those seeking more security, this specialized build
      sacrifices minimal damage for significantly improved survival chances by reaching 100%
      affinity without tenderizing - particularly valuable since maintaining tenderized parts on
      Alatreon can be challenging.

          "The four empty level 1 slots provide flexible customization. Consider Blight Resistance 3 to negate all blights (especially important for preventing Dragonblight, which nullifies elemental damage), Divine Blessing for damage reduction, or Attack Boost 4 if you're confident in your play.

  <Section title="The Legendary Black Dragon - MR 100🎖️">
    <p>
      Fatalis represents the pinnacle challenge in Monster Hunter World, featuring devastating
      attacks that can one-shot hunters without appropriate preparation. Breaking his head once
      weakens his fire attacks in the final phase, while breaking it twice significantly reduces the
      fight's difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Confident players can tackle Fatalis with our MR100 raw build. For those seeking extra
      security, this specialized defensive build maintains strong damage output while incorporating
      valuable survival skills. We'll use Alatreon's lance, which offers less raw than the
      Lightbreak Lance but compensates with dragon element (Fatalis's weakness) and exceptional
      sharpness.
    </p>

    <p>
      This extended sharpness bar allows us to abandon Master's Touch in favor of Divine Blessing
      Secret, providing crucial damage reduction. The strategy works particularly well against
      Fatalis due to numerous sharpening opportunities during phase transitions, mini-novas, and
      flying sequences.
