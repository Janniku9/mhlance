      Yay, you've beaten the story! Now it's time to start with the Endgame Grind. Specifically
      we're gonna be focusing on 3 things:
    </p>

    <StyledList
      items={[
        {
          text: 'Leveling up the Guiding Lands to get special materials for Augmenting our weapons and upgrading our charms.',
        },
        {
          text: 'Farming Decorations to get the skills we need for our builds.',
        },
        {
          text: 'Clearing Special Assignments to unlock new monsters and level up our Master Rank.',
        },
      ]}
    />
  </Section>

  <Section title="Welcome To The Grinding Lands - MR 24🎖️">
    <p>
      The first thing we're gonna do is put together a strong set that helps us farm the Guiding
      Lands and clear the first few Special Assignments.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you're able to clear the Frostfang Barioth event quest(available at MR24) you can craft
      it's weapon since it's a straight upgrade to the Kulu Lance. It's the first Lance with purple
      Sharpness and it comes with Ice element, which is great because the next few monsters are all
      weak to Ice.
    </p>

    <p>
      A lot of monsters from here on are also gonna be hitting a lot harder and it starts becoming
      more important to have Guard 5 and Guard Up. Therefore we're gonna be including both in our
      build. If you don't have a Guard Up Decoration you can get one from the Elder melder (only
      after beating the story). Since we're most likely lacking Decorations at this point we're
      gonna be using the Seething Bazelgeuse mail to get Guard 5.
    </p>

    <p>
      From here on we're also gonna be including Fortify in our builds. It's a really good skill for
      the Guiding Lands since there's no faint limit and the Damage is boost is pretty significant
      and lasts for 50 minutes.
    </p>

        description: [
          "We're upgrading our weapon to the Frostfang Barioth Lance, which comes with purple Sharpness and very high Raw. To keep the purple Sharpness we're still using 3 piece Teostra. With the remaining 2 pieces and the charm we're gonna try to get Guard 5 and Offensive Guard 3. We're also gonna add a level of Fortify to our build, which will give us a nice Damage boost for the Guiding Lands.",

  <Section title="The Master Of All Elements - MR 100🎖️">
    <p>
      After doing the Safi'jiiva recon we unlock the Alatreon Special Assignment. Alatreon can be a
      real challenge to tackle if you aren't prepared well enough. He has 3 different forms: Fire,
      Ice and Dragon. In the assignment he'l always start in Fire where he's weakest to Ice. After a
      while he's transforming into Dragon where he eventually does his nova the escaton judgement.
      If you didn't deal enough Elemental Damage to him you'll die to this attack. After the Escaton
      Judgment he'll then switch to Ice mode unless you break his Horns. If you manage to break his
      Horns he'll go back to Fire mode again.
    </p>

    <p>
      Therefore our game plan is to use an Ice weapon and deal enough Elemental Damage to weaken his
      escation judgement. We also need to break his Horns so he won't switch to Ice mode where we
      won't be dealing any Damage.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the weapon we choose the Frostfang Barioth Lance. It has enough Ice to get the Elemental
      Topple and has high Raw. Funnily enough alatreon's hitzones are actually better for Raw Damage
      than for Elemental Damage. So we don't want sacrifice too much Raw for element, just the right
      amount to get the topple. Now if you are having troubles getting the Elemental Topple you can
      farm the Safi or Kjarr Ice Lance. They are random drops though so it might take a while to get
      them.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you feel comfortable with his moveset and know the Tenderize openings you can just go with
      the MR100 Raw build and slap on the Frostfang Lance. Otherwise I put together a more comfy
      build that doesn't sacrifice too much Damage but adds a lot of survivability. The biggest
      advantage of this build is that you hit 100% Affinity without tenderizing parts which is
      really nice in this fight since keeping Alatreon Tenderized can be a bit tricky.
    </p>

    <BuildCard
      build={{
        title: 'Anti Alatreon Set',
        description: [
          "We're bringing back the Frostfang Barioth Lance. As we already know, it's a pretty good weapon and it comes with enough Ice to get the Elemental Topple. For the set we use 3 piece Teostra for Master's Touch paired with the Rbrachy greaves and the Frostfang Barioth helm.We use this piece combination to fit the skills to make it wexless.",
          "The four empty 1 slots can be used for whatever you need. You can get blight resistance 3 to negate all blights. Dragon blight is especially annoying because it makes you deal 0 Elemental Damage and you need Elemental Damage to survive escaton judgement. Ice and Water blight are also annoying because they make you consume Stamina faster and we need Stamina to block. Then you could also get Divine Blessing 3 to reduce Damage taken. And if you're not struggling with any of these you can just add Attack Boost 4.",

  <Section title="The Legendary Black Dragon - MR 100🎖️">
    <p>
      Fatalis is considered the Hardest Monster in the game. He has a lot of really powerful Attacks
      that can straight up Oneshot you if you're not careful. Breaking his head will weaken his Fire
      Attacks in the last phase. It can be broken twice and if you manage to do so the fight becomes
      a lot easier.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you feel comfortable with his moveset you can just go with the MR100 Raw build we've seen
      earlier. Otherwise I put together a super defensive build without sacrificing too much Damage.
      For the build we're gonna use alatreon's Lance. It has less Raw than the Lightbreak Lance but
      comes with Dragon element (which is Fatalis weakness) and an insane Sharpness bar. It's
      Sharpness allows us to drop Master's Touch and add Divine Blessing secret for some extra
      survivability. This works really well in this fight because he's gonna give us a lot of
      opportunities to sharpen our weapon (2x phase transition, 3x mini nova, flying ...).
