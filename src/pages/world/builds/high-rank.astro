  <Section>
    <p>
      Welcome to High Rank! This is where Monster Hunter World truly opens up with meaningful
      equipment choices and skill combinations. You'll now obtain decorations and have access to
      both alpha (more skills) and beta (more slots) armor versions.
    </p>

    <p>
      First priority: purchase the Power and Armor Charms from the Tradeyard. These provide flat
      stat increases just by being in your inventory. After encountering Bazelgeuse (the new invader
      monster), you can upgrade them to Power and Armor Talons. The charms and talons stack, so
      ideally you'll carry all four items for maximum benefit.
    </p>

    <p>
      The builds on this page follow your progression through the story and include endgame setups
      for decoration farming and Iceborne preparation. Due to the random nature of decoration drops,
      the progression builds only include decorations you receive from the story itself.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="Defender/Guardian Gear" />

    <p>
      Defender Weapons and Guardian Armor were added to help players rush to Iceborne. While
      extremely powerful and easy to craft, using this gear bypasses the genuine Monster Hunter
      experience of gradually building your arsenal and learning monster patterns. I recommend
      avoiding it for your first playthrough, but the choice is yours.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="Multiplayer Tip: Flinch Free" />
    <p>
      If you play with others regularly, consider including Flinch Free in your build. Just one
      level prevents most teammate knockbacks, allowing you to maintain your offensive pressure in
      crowded situations. You can either use a level 3 decoration (once you find one) or replace the
      helmets in these builds with Gastodon or later Xeno'jiiva for built-in Flinch Free.
    </p>

  <Section title="Entering High Rank - 6⭐">
    <p>
      After your first High Rank Pukei-Pukei encounter, you'll need to gather Rathian tracks. Use
      optional quests to collect tracks while gathering new High Rank materials from bone piles, ore
      outcrops, and small monsters.
    </p>

    <p>
      With enough quality bones, it's time to switch from the Bone Lance to the Odogaron tree. You
      can either roll back your Hard Bone Lance II or craft a fresh Bone Lance to follow the
      Odogaron path up to the Garon Lance II. This switch is worth the investment, as the Odogaron
      Lance offers excellent affinity and blue sharpness, making it significantly stronger than
      continuing the Bone tree.
    </p>

    <BuildCard
      build={{
        title: 'Red Dog Rising',
        description: [
          'The Odogaron Lance brings substantial affinity and blue sharpness, immediately outperforming our previous Bone Lance. This weapon tree remains strong throughout High Rank, culminating in natural white sharpness and high critical rate - making now the perfect time to switch.',
          "For armor, we're essentially upgrading to High Rank versions of our previous pieces. While skill options remain limited at this stage, the increased defense helps against harder-hitting monsters. Health Boost and Attack Boost remain our priority skills until we access better offensive options soon.",

  <Section title="Exploring Elder's Recess - 7⭐">
    <p>
      Upon reaching Elder's Recess, you'll need to collect Nergigante tracks. Use this opportunity
      to hunt the new region's monsters and gather unique materials. The Elder's Recess mining spots
      provide ore for crafting the High Rank Ingot Vambraces, a direct upgrade to your armor set.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many Low Rank monsters now appear with High Rank versions, dropping materials for stronger
      armor. Focus first on hunting High Rank Odogaron to craft its coil and upgrade your lance to
      Garon Dhara I. Next, hunt Rathalos for its helm, mail, and greaves to round out your set with
      powerful offensive skills.
    </p>

    <BuildCard
      build={{
        title: 'Weakness Exploiter',
        description: [
          'With our upgraded Garon Dhara I, we gain more affinity and extended blue sharpness. The real game-changer is the Rathalos armor combination, which provides Weakness Exploit 3 - granting 50% bonus affinity when hitting monster weak spots. This transforms our lance from solid to exceptional.',
          "The Ingot Vambraces give us Health Boost 2, providing crucial survivability as we prepare to face Elder Dragons. This mixed set balances impressive damage output with enough defense to handle High Rank's tougher challenges.",

  <Section title="Facing The Elder Dragons - 8⭐">
    <p>
      After defeating Nergigante, you gain access to the Dober Mail, an excellent offensive chest
      piece that we'll incorporate into our build.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your next assignment involves collecting Elder Dragon tracks before facing them directly. Each
      Elder Dragon provides unique materials for powerful equipment:

        { text: "Kushala Daora: Unfortunately doesn't offer much for lance builds", emoji: '🌪️' },
      ]}
    />

    <p>
      Defeating Vaal Hazak allows us to upgrade our charm to the Ironside Charm III. Teostra will
      give us access to some really powerful armor pieces. With the Teostra material we can get the
      final Lance upgrade. Lastly there's Kushala Daora, which doesn't give us anything useful for
      Lance.

      After defeating Xeno'jiiva, you've completed Monster Hunter World's base story. You now have

    <SectionSubTitle title="Starting Iceborne" />

    <p>
      Beginning Iceborne immediately makes story progression slightly more challenging, but you'll
      reach Master Rank's endgame faster with access to better decorations and gear. You can always
      return later with stronger equipment to unlock remaining content and mantles.
