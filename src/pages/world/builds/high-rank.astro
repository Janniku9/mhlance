    <p>
      After repelling Zorah Magdaros we will enter High Rank. From High Rank onwards we will obtain
      Decorations and most armor sets will have an alpha and beta version.Alpha sets will have more
      skills, while beta sets sacrifice skills for more slots
    </p>

    <p>
      We can now purchase the Power And Armor Charms at the tradeyard. These items will give you
      Flat Stat Increases for just having them in your inventory. They can be quite expensive so
      better save up to buy them as soon as possible. In High Rank there's also the first Invader
      Monster that loves to disturb your hunts. With its materials you can upgrade your Power And
      Armor Charms to talons. The talons will give you an even bigger stat increase than the charms
      and the best part is they stack with the charms so ideally you buy new ones after you upgrade
      your old ones to talons.
    </p>

    <p>
      On this page you can find Progression Builds that will help you get through the story as well
      as some Endgame Builds that you can use to Farm Decorations and prepare for Iceborne.
    </p>

    <p>
      Due to the randomness of what Decorations you get, the progression sets will not include any
      Decorations except for the ones you receive from the story. The Endgame Sets will include
      decos that you can farm from Event Quests after you finish the story.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title=" Defender/Guardian Gear " />

    <p>
      Defender Weapons and Guardian Armor are Special Gear that got added to the game in preparation
      for the release of Iceborne. They are meant to help players get through the Base Game as fast
      as possible, so they can start diving into the Expansion Content. The Defender Gear is very
      easy to craft and upgrade, while also being extremely powerful.
    </p>

    <p>
      I personally don't recommend using the Defender Gear on your first playthrough. Getting to
      explore the different Weapon Trees and Armor Skills, having to grind materials to craft sets
      ... are all essential parts of the Monster Hunter experience that you will miss out on.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="Important Note For Multiplayer Enjoyers" />
    <p>
      If you are playing with friends a lot you might want to include Flinch Free in your build. If
      you have Flinch Free 1 you won't get Knocked Back by most Attacks from your teammates. You can
      get it with a 3 slot Decoration, but since it's rng if you get it or not, there's an
      alternative solution. You can just replace all helmets in the Progression Builds with the
      Gastodon and later with the Xeno'jiiva helmet.
    </p>

  <Section title="Entering High Rank - 6⭐">
    <p>
      After fighting your first Pukei-pukei in High Rank you receive a task to collect Rathian
      tracks. We can look for those tracks on Optional Quests where we can also collect new High
      Rank materials from Bonepiles, Outcrops and small monsters.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we manage to get enough quality bones from small monsters, we can finally switch to a
      different Weapon Tree: the Odogaron Lance. You can either rollback your Hard Bone Lance II a
      few times or craft a new bone Lance and follow the Odogaron tree all the way to the garon
      Lance II.

          "The armor we are crafting is pretty much just the High Rank version of the armor we used in the beginning of Low Rank. There's still not really a lot of good offensive skills available so we are sticking to Health Boost and Attack Boost.",

  <Section title="Exploring Elder's Recess - 7⭐">
    <p>
      After reaching Elder's Recess we have to collect more tracks. This time we are looking for
      Nergigante. While doing that you can hunt the new monsters that inhabit this new region,
      collect bones and mine Outcrops. With the newly mined materials from the Elder's Recess we can
      craft the High Rank Ingot Vambraces.
    </p>

    <p>
      A lot of monsters from Low Rank also appear in Expeditions now, but they are significantly
      stronger and provide us with High Rank materials that we can use to craft stronger versions of
      their Low Rank armor. First we want to hunt High Rank Odogaron a few times until we can craft
      it's coil. With the same materials we can also upgrade our weapon, this time to the Garon
      Dhara I.
    </p>

    <p>Next we also want to hunt Rathalos a few times and craft it's helm, mail and greaves.</p>

        description: [
          'The new weapon upgrade got as a lot of Affinity and more blue Sharpness. With the Rathalos pieces we can get Weakness Exploit 3, which will give us 50% Affinity on weakspots.

  <Section title="Facing The Elder Dragons - 8⭐">
    <p>
      By beating Nergigante we defeated our first Elder Dragon, which unlocks the Dober Mail, which
      we will use for our new chest piece.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once again we get a new task to Collect Tracks, this time from Elder Dragons. After collecting
      enough tracks we will be able to fight them and use their materials to craft new armor.
    </p>

    <p>
      Defeating Vaal Hazak allows us to upgrade our charm to the Ironside Charm III. Teostra will
      give us access to some really powerful armor pieces. With the Teostra material we can get the
      final Lance upgrade. Lastly there's Kushala Daora, which doesn't give us anything useful for
      Lance.
    </p>

    <BuildCard

With the newly upgraded Odogaron Lance we have a lot of Affinity so we will able to keep our white Sharpness for a long time.",
          "The Ironside Charm III will give us Guard 3, which makes blocking some Attacks a bit easier. If you don't need the Guard skill you can switch it to a different one, for example the Expert Charm III to get to 100% Affinity.",

  <Section title="Preparing For Iceborne - 9⭐">
    <p>
      After defeating Xeno'jiiva we finish the story of Monster Hunter World. From here on you have
      two options:
    </p>

    <StyledList
      items={[
        { text: 'continue with the Base World Endgame content' },
        { text: 'Start the iceborne expansion' },
      ]}
    />

    <SectionSubTitle title="Starting Iceborne" />

    <p>
      Starting with Iceborne right away will make Story Progression slightly more difficult, but
      you'll reach the real endgame faster and can farm better Decorations And Gear more easily. You
      can always come back later when you are already stronger and unlock the Remaining Content and
      especially the Mantles.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want to start with Iceborne right away, you can find some builds for the early Master
      Rank story in the next section.
    </p>

    <NavigationButton href="/world/builds/master-rank" text="Iceborne Builds" emoji="❄️" />

    <SectionSubTitle title="Continuing High Rank" />

    <p>
      You can unlock stronger gear by fighting arch tempered Elders, Kulve Taroth or Behemoth. You
      can farm various Decorations like Attack Jewel, tenderizer jewels, critical jewels or Ironwall
      jewels by doing Event Quests like 'The Name's Lavasioth'. Or you can unlock strong Mantles
      like the Temporal, Rocksteady, Evasion or Impact mantle by doing Tempered Investigations. All
      of this will help you prepare for Master Rank.
    </p>

    <p>if you continue with High Rank, you have two options for your Endgame Armor:</p>

    <StyledList
      items={[
        {
          text: "The best armor is the drachen armor from Behemoth. But Behemoth is a difficult fight that only has 4 player scaling. Which means it's pretty much impossible to solo. So unless you are playing with friends that are up for the challenge or are super lucky to find a online session with people that are willing to help, the second set is probably the better option. ",
        },
        {
          text: "The second option is doing Arch Tempered Teostra as well as other AT Elders, which you'll unlock at HR 50. Their materials will allow you to craft the gamma version of the Teostra armor, which is a straight upgrade to the normal version. The Kaiser Gamma Set is slightly weaker than the drachen set but it only requires content that you can do solo. ",
        },
