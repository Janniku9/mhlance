      You finally beat the last monster of the game, Fatalis. Congratulations! Now you just need to
      farm him for his armor and weapons. But what should you build? Here are some suggestions.
    </p>

  <Section title="The Fatalis Empire" emoji="🐉">
    <p>
      The Fatalis Lance is by far the best Lance in the game. It has the highest Raw and although it
      has a lot of negative Affinity, the Fatalis armor makes it possible to reach 100% Affinity
      anyways. These Fatalis Raw builds are the best option for pretty much every monster in the
      game. Except for maybe Alatreon.
    </p>

    <p>
      The armor has so many slots that you can fit in pretty much every skill you want. I wanna
      share a template that has high damage but also some comfort and defensive skills.
    </p>

Transcendence is a new set bonus that gives us Max Hp and Stamina as well as True Razor Sharp for Sharpness management. Inheritance on the other hand unlocks all skill secrets.

    <p>
      Alatreon is a very weird monster when it comes to his hitzones. He actually has really good
      Raw Hitzones while his Elemental Hitzones aren't that great, especially if he's in his Dragon
      form.
    </p>

    <p>
      This means that the fastest way to kill him is actually by using a Raw weapon. The problem
      with that is that you need to deal enough Elemental Damage to weaken his escaton judgement if
      you want to survive it. Now what you can do is just slot in Fortify and cart to escaton
      judgement or use one of the following elemental sets.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are using the Safi Awakenings to control the amount of element we get. It is possible to
      get the Elemental Topple with no element awakening, although it's really really difficult. I
      recommend using 2-4 element awakenings, but it really depends on your aggression and
      proficiency in the fight. Generally anything with 400+ display element should be good enough.
