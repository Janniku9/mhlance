    <p>
      Congratulations on conquering Fatalis, the ultimate challenge of Monster Hunter World! Now
      that you've defeated the legendary Black Dragon, it's time to harness its power by crafting
      the game's strongest equipment. This section showcases the definitive endgame builds for
      lance.
    </p>

  <Section title="The Fatalis Empire" emoji="🐉">
    <p>
      The Fatalis Lance stands uncontested as the premier weapon for lance users. Its exceptional
      raw damage overcomes the negative affinity penalty through the equally powerful Fatalis armor
      set. This combination represents the pinnacle of lance builds, optimal for virtually every
      monster in the game with the possible exception of Alatreon.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fatalis armor's abundance of decoration slots allows for unprecedented build flexibility. The
      template below balances peak damage output with practical defensive skills, creating a
      comfortable yet powerful endgame experience.

  <Section title="Anti Alatreon Sets" emoji="🐲">
    <p>
      Alatreon presents a unique endgame challenge with its unusual hitzone values. Despite common
      assumptions, Alatreon actually features excellent raw hitzones while its elemental hitzones
      are less impressive, especially during Dragon active state.
    </p>

    <p>
      This creates an interesting optimization puzzle: the fastest kill times come from raw-focused
      weapons, but you must deal sufficient elemental damage to survive the Escaton Judgment. While
      experienced hunters might choose to run Fortify and simply accept the cart from Escaton, these
      specialized elemental builds offer a more consistent approach.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Safi'jiiva weapons provide ideal customization through their awakening system. By
      carefully balancing elemental and raw awakenings, we can meet the elemental threshold while
      maintaining strong raw damage. Any lance with 400+ displayed element should comfortably reach
      the topple threshold with aggressive play.
