      Welcome to Master Rank! Iceborne introduces tougher challenges with monsters hitting harder,
      moving faster, and having significantly more health. The builds in this guide will help you
      navigate through the expansion's story with minimal decoration requirements.
    </p>

    <p>
      These progression builds only use easily obtainable decorations: the free Attack Boost and
      Expert+ jewels from the story, Vitality jewels from the Elder Melder, plus one each of
      Tenderizer, Elementless, and Expert jewels. No rare decorations required.
    </p>

      Master Rank begins in the new Hoarfrost Reach region. As always, start by gathering materials
      from bone piles and mining outcrops while exploring and fighting new monsters. After
      completing "Banbaro Blockade" (the second assigned quest), you'll unlock several powerful
      early armor pieces and weapons.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can also find Master Rank versions of familiar monsters in expeditions and optional
      quests, allowing you to craft improved versions of their equipment right away.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our initial target is Master Rank Kulu-Ya-Ku to craft the Minqar Al-Nasr I lance and its
      greaves. Next, hunt Barroth for its helmet and coil, then focus on the new monster Banbaro for
      its excellent vambraces and mail.

  <Section title="Discovering New Subspecies - 2⭐">
    <p>
      During MR 2 star quests, you'll encounter various subspecies of familiar monsters.
      Unfortunately, none of them offer particularly useful lance or armor pieces at this point.
      Focus on completing the assigned quests to advance the story while gathering materials for
      future upgrades.

    <p>
      MR 3 star introduces several powerful returning monsters: Barioth, Nargacuga, Glavenus,
      Tigrex, and Brachydios. Nargacuga is particularly important for us, as its materials allow
      upgrading to the Minqar Al-Nasr II.

      <p>
        For armor, search for Master Rank Uragaan in investigations or optional quests to craft its
        greaves. Also hunt Brachydios for its helmet, which offers Agitator and useful decoration
        slots.

        After your first encounter with Velkhana, you'll face several new monsters: Shrieking
        Legiana, Fulgur Anjanath, Ebony Odogaron, and Acidic Glavenus.
      </p>

      <p>
        Complete the housekeeping quests "The Purr-fect Room: Stone" and "The Purr-fect Room: Light
        Iron" to obtain the Razor Sharp Charm, which solves our sharpness management issues. Since
        we're changing charms, we need a new source of Weakness Exploit - farm Rathalos for its
        chest piece.

        At Master Rank 19, you'll encounter Master Rank versions of base game Elder Dragons. This
        means we can finally hunt Teostra again and access the invaluable Master's Touch set bonus.
      </p>

      <p>
        We'll also craft the Offensive Guard Charm II, which requires a Phantom Core Ore. The most
        reliable way to obtain this material is through mantle upgrade quests: either "A Nasty Flesh
        Wound" (Bandit Mantle) or "Proud White Knight" (Evasion Mantle).

        MR 6★ contains just two quests before facing the final boss, Shara Ishvalda, and reaching
        Master Rank 24. Neither quest provides worthwhile equipment upgrades for our build, so we'll
        complete the story using our current setup.
      </p>

      <p>
        Defeating Shara Ishvalda is just the beginning, you'll unlock the Guiding Lands and various
        Special Assignments, opening up the true endgame. The builds we've developed will serve as a
        solid foundation as you begin tackling the challenging post-story content.
