    <p>
      After completing Low Rank, you'll witness the far-reaching consequences of the Dragontorch
      incident as ecosystems across the Easternlands undergo dramatic transformations. Crystalline
      corruption spreads through monster populations, and your previous victories have set in motion
      changes that reach far beyond what you could have imagined.
    </p>

    <p>
      The good news? Your Low Rank Burst Boost setup remains surprisingly effective since it's still
      one of the strongest damage sources available in early High Rank. However, we can make a small
      upgrade by switching to the Chatacabra chest piece, which grants Weakness Exploit level 1 for
      both a damage boost and improved defense.
    </p>

    <InfoBox type="tip">
      <p>
        You are able to find monsters you encountered previsously as well as new ones roaming around
        the locales. You can always start a quest to hunt them to get their materials.
      </p>
    </InfoBox>

    <p>
      <strong>Balahara:</strong>
      Its materials enable upgrading your lance to level 3, providing a substantial damage increase that
      will carry you through the early High Rank challenges.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Rathian:</strong> Don't pass up opportunities to hunt this classic wyvern. Rathian materials
      are essential for crafting the Exploiter Charm (Weakness Exploit 1), a cornerstone accessory that
      will appear in many future builds throughout your High Rank journey.

    <p>
      As Chapter 4 unfolds, you'll face familiar Guardian monsters in their enhanced, more dangerous
      forms. These corrupted versions demand respect, but they also provide access to superior
      materials for crafting our next major upgrade.
    </p>

    <p>
      We'll construct a 4-piece Guardian Rathalos set that maximizes Weakness Exploit while
      incorporating the Guardian Ebony Odogaron Helmet to keep having at least one level of burst.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the weapon, we will also go with the Guardian Rathalos lance. While we don't yet have the
      affinity to fully capitalize on its Master's Touch property, its superior base stats make it
      the clear best option at this rank.

  <Section title="Frozen Tempest- 5⭐ [HR 31+]">
    <p>
      Chapter 5 brings catastrophic weather patterns as unnatural blizzards engulf entire regions.
      You'll finally confront Jin Dahaad's true power in its frozen domain while uncovering the dark
      origins of the Frenzy virus that has been corrupting monsters throughout your journey.
    </p>

    <p>
      The source of this spreading plague? None other than the returning Gore Magala, and once
      again, its signature armor skills prove devastatingly effective. The 2-piece set bonus
      inflicts you with the Frenzy virus—but this apparent curse becomes a blessing when you deal
      enough damage to cure yourself, granting substantial free affinity.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Antivirus skill creates perfect synergy with this mechanic, providing additional affinity
      while cured for a total of 25% affinity bonus. Even better, the 4-piece Gore Magala set grants
      +10 raw attack while infected and an additional +5 while cured (15 total), making this one of
      the strongest armor combinations available until true endgame.
    </p>

    <p>
      For our weapon upgrade, we'll enhance the Guardian Rathalos lance to its final form. This
      requires Hunter Symbol II, obtainable from 6-star tempered investigations. The resulting
      weapon ranks among the best craftable lances and will serve you well for quite some time.
    </p>

    <InfoBox type="warning">
      Don't forget to complete the 5-star quest 'As Gatekeeper' to unlock the Powercharm—a simple
      inventory item that provides a permanent raw attack boost just by carrying it.

  <Section title="The Eternal Hunt - 6⭐ [HR 50+]">
    <p>
      In the final chapter of high rank, you'll confront the harsh reality of what it truly means to
      maintain balance as a Hunter. You'll discover that preserving the natural order is an ongoing
      responsibility rather than a problem that can be solved once and for all.
    </p>

    <p>
      This chapter reintroduces both Arkveld and Zoh Shia, unlocking access to superior armor and
      weapons. Zoh Shia deserves special attention for its incredibly efficient chest piece, which
      allows us to upgrade our Gore setup while maintaining the powerful 4-piece bonus.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Zoh Shia lance might just be the finest craftable lance available, featuring excellent raw
      damage and sharpness. Its true strength lies in the Whiteflame Torrent weapon skill—similar to
      Sunbreak's Powder Mantle—which triggers random bonus damage procs on your attacks. These extra
      hits may seem modest individually, but they accumulate into substantial damage increases over
      the course of a hunt.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now is also the perfect time to focus on investigations. Farm decorations aggressively while
      collecting materials and Artian Weapon parts needed for crafting the ultimate endgame Artian
      Lances that await in your future.
    </p>

    <p>
      The build below showcases optimal decoration usage, but don't stress if your collection isn't
      complete yet—simply use the best decorations available and upgrade as you find better options.

      Completing High Rank's story campaign unlocks the true endgame experience. You'll gain full
      access to high-level tempered investigations, which serve as your primary source for farming
      Artian Weapon parts and the rarest decorations.
    </p>

    <p>
      The ultimate challenge awaits in the form of Arch Tempered Apex monsters, whose materials
      craft some of the most powerful armor pieces in the game. These encounters will test
      everything you've learned about lance combat and monster behavior.
