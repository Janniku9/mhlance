    <p>
      Wilds takes a notably different approach to low rank compared to previous games. The
      experience is more guided and cinematic, pushing you from one encounter to the next with less
      of that classic Monster Hunter exploration feel. This also means you'll gather fewer materials
      and might need to do some extra grinding for gear.
    </p>

    <p>
      Low rank armor doesn't offer many exciting skills either, most pieces are just stat sticks
      with higher defense values. For the most part, you'll want to craft whatever materials allow,
      upgrading primarily for the defense boost rather than skill synergies.
    </p>

    <p>
      This guide offers some solid recommendations for what to prioritize, but don't feel pressured
      to grind out these exact sets if you're getting by with what you have.

  <Section title="Rescue In The Sandstorm - 1⭐">
    <p>
      Your starting Hope Lance and armor will carry you through the opening quests just fine. Keep
      an eye out for mining nodes—once you snag your first iron ore, you can upgrade the Hope Lance
      to Hope Lance II for a nice early damage boost.
    </p>

    <BuildCard
      build={{
        title: 'desert survivor',
        description: [
          'Your starting gear with the Hope Lance upgraded to tier II. Simple but effective.',
        ],
        image: starter,
        imageAlt: 'desert survivor set',
        stats: {

            peak: 0,
          },
        },
      }}
    />

    <p>
      The first chapter takes you through the forbidden lands, introducing you to seikret mechanics
      and the local ecosystem while you tackle new monsters across the plains and forest locales.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="Progression Weapons" />
    <p>
      Two weapon trees stand out as solid choices for low rank progression, each offering different
      strengths.
    </p>

    <StyledList
      items={[
        {
          text: 'Balahara Lance I',
          subtext:
            'Comes with Offensive Guard, boosting your damage when you nail those perfectly-timed blocks. Slightly higher damage potential if you can master the timing.',
        },
        {
          text: 'Lala Barina Lanza I',
          subtext:
            'Brings solid paralysis buildup with built-in Critical Status, plus an impressively long sharpness bar. Great comfort pick that trades a bit of raw damage for comfort.',
        },
      ]}
    />

    <p>
      Both weapons are excellent choices with different upgrade points throughout the story, so
      you'll likely find yourself switching between them as materials become available.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="Optional Starter Set" />
    <p>
      Since offensive skills are basically non-existent this early, armor upgrades mainly provide
      defense or quality-of-life improvements. Feel free to skip this if your current gear is
      working fine.
    </p>

    <BuildCard
      build={{

        stats: {

  <Section title="Ecosystem In Collapse - 2⭐">
    <p>
      Chapter two opens up the Oilwell Basin, where you'll uncover more about the mysterious
      Everforge. As sandstorms ravage the desert, you'll dive deeper into the complex ecosystem of
      these forbidden lands.
    </p>

    <p>This chapter offers some modest upgrades, nothing game-changing but worth considering.</p>

    <p>
      You'll face a quest with three Hirabami simultaneously—basically a free materials jackpot for
      crafting their armor pieces. The Kranodath Chest pairs well here to maintain some Flinch Free,
      using materials from those small monsters roaming the Oilwell Basin.
    </p>

    <p>
      Your encounter with Nerscylla provides the materials to upgrade the Lala Barina Lance to
      Barina Sarissa II, gaining more raw damage and an even more generous green sharpness bar.
    </p>

    <BuildCard

  <Section title="Guardians Of Ancient Wyveria - 3⭐">
    <p>
      Chapter three brings you to the ancient ruins of Wyveria, where you'll encounter the
      Guardians, which are artificially created monsters that once protected these ruins. Something
      has stirred them from their slumber, and they're acting out of control.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first one you encounter, Guardian Doshaguma drops the materials needed to upgrade your
      Balahara Lance to tier two, unlocking another level of Offensive Guard. This is a substantial
      damage boost and absolutely worth prioritizing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, some proper damage skills become available! The standout set here is a 4-piece
      Guardian Ebony Odogaron build, granting Burst level 3 and Burst Boost 2. These skills provide
      significant raw and elemental damage bonuses as long as you maintain consistent hits, which is
      very easy to maintain for lance. This actually outperforms a weakness exploit set using
      Rathalos gear, as currently there's just not enough skills to make a crit build worth it.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="The end of Low Rank" />
    <p>
      After defeating Guardian Arkveld and preventing the Incubation at the Dragontorch, low rank's
      story concludes. But your journey is just beginning—high rank awaits with even more formidable
      monsters and powerful equipment to discover.
