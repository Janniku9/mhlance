    <Comment> last updated for AT Uth Duna </Comment>

    <p>
      These are the current endgame builds for Title Update 2, which added Seregios and Lagiacrus.
      All of these assume you've completed the main story and have access to the highest rarity
      Artian weapons, plus pretty much all decorations and armor pieces.
    </p>

    <p>
      They require you to have completed the main story and unlocked the ability to craft the
      highest rarity Artian weapons, as well as having access to pretty much all decorations and
      armor pieces in the game.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="Weapons" />

    <p>
      Artian weapons are still the best option in the game by a wide margin. They all come with
      three level-3 slots, which lets you stack the weapon skills that lance really needs. The
      reinforcement system also gives them the best stats for almost every element or status, making
      most craftable lances pretty obsolete.
    </p>

    <p>
      When crafting new Artian weapons, try to get three parts with the same element or status, plus
      an attack infusion. This basically guarantees you to get the element you want while maximizing
      the attack production bonus.
    </p>

    <p>
      For reinforcement bonuses, aim for 1 sharpness and 4 attack. Even if you only get 2-3 attack
      reinforcements, it'll still outperform the craftable alternatives.
    </p>

    <p>Here's how to use those 3 weapon decoration slots:</p>
    <StyledList
      items={[
        {
          text: 'Offensive Guard 3',
          subtext: "Lance's most important weapon skill for damage",
          emoji: '⚔️',
        },
        {
          text: "Master's Touch 3 or Razor Sharp 3",
          subtext: 'Essential for maintaining sharpness during long fights',
          emoji: '🗡️',
        },
        {
          text: 'Critical Boost 3',
          subtext: 'Great damage skill, but prioritize the other two first',
          emoji: '💥',
        },
      ]}
    />

    <p>
      Offensive Guard comes with combo decorations that include guard, handicraft, or elemental
      attack. Pick based on what you need—guard for tough matchups, handicraft if you're struggling
      with sharpness, or elemental attack for a small damage boost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since our affinity is pretty high now, Master's Touch is usually better for sharpness
      management. You can also use combo Razor Sharp + ironwall decorations if you prefer running
      guard 2 as the master's touch is not available as a combo decoration.
    </p>

    <InfoBox>
      <p>
        The Lagiacrus lance can actually match or beat the Artian Thunder Lance in very
        elemental-heavy matchups like Seregios, especially if you stack thunder resistance. When
        using it, eat a meal that maxes elemental resistances and use your 1-slots for more thunder
        resistance. For longer hunts, the Artian might still win due to better sharpness.
      </p>
    </InfoBox>

    <p>
      For other craftable options, the <CodeBlock text="Blazing Sital" /> from Zoh Shia has a unique
      weapon skill, while the Guardian Rathalos lance <CodeBlock text="Shining Pillar" /> offers good
      stats and slot efficiency.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="Element vs Raw" />
    <p>
      Since Artian weapons can all reach the same raw damage, using elemental ones just adds free
      damage on top. If you can afford to make 6 different Artian lances (5 element and 1
      status/raw), definitely do it. Using the right element typically adds 5-10% damage, which
      really adds up over time.
    </p>

    <p>Check the matchup table to see which element works best against each monster.</p>

    <NavigationButton href="/wilds/data/match-ups" text="matchup chart" emoji="📊" />

    <p>
      If you want to stick with raw weapons, blast is generally the best option, though paralysis is
      also solid for the openings it creates.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="Armor" />
    <p>
      All three builds here use Guts, the set bonus from wearing 3 pieces of any Arch-Tempered Apex
      monster armor. Guts lets you survive a lethal hit if you're above 40% health, and as long as
      it hasn't been triggered recently, it gives you a 5% raw damage bonus. Combined with how
      skill-efficient these armor pieces are, it makes Guts one of the strongest skills available.
    </p>

    <p>
      The builds are very similar in damage output, but each has different strengths and use cases.
    </p>

    <p>Now with all that covered, let's take a look at the builds.</p>
  </Section>

  <Section title="latent power set" emoji="💪">
    <p>
      This build uses 3 pieces of Rey Dau combined with the best-in-slot armor pieces available,
      letting us max out both Agitator and Weakness Exploit.
    </p>

    <p>
      The key feature is high Latent Power levels, giving this set the highest theoretical damage
      output. The downside is that Latent Power can be inconsistent, as it has high up and down
      times. And when the up times overlap with zone transitions, or timings in the fight where you
      can't attack or deal less damage due to monster states, it can lead to damage loss.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you get hit a lot, you actually will have a higher latent power uptime. If this is an
      advantage solely depends on you :)
    </p>

        },
      }}
    />
  </Section>

  <Section title="azure bolt set" emoji="⚡">
    <p>
      This set uses 2 pieces of Lagiacrus for the Azure Bolt set bonus, trading some raw power for
      much more consistent damage output.
    </p>

    <p>
      While the Lagiacrus pieces make this slightly weaker than the Latent Power set on paper, Azure
      Bolt provides more reliable affinity uptime with shorter cycles. The set bonus also adds free
      damage procs that aren't reflected in the displayed stats. We also get 2 levels of Stamina
      Surge, which helps maintain Maximum Might uptime.

        },
      }}
    />
  </Section>

  <Section title="comfy zoh shia set" emoji="❤️‍🩹">
    <p>
      Alternatively, there's this third set which is a really comfy variant using the Zoh Shia super
      recovery set bonus, which allows you to recover health passively even without having red
      health. This is really nice for us, as it can help a lot with damage building up from chip or
      smaller hits, meaning you need to heal less often, allowing you to focus more on attacking.
    </p>

    <p>
      Overall, this set has only around 1-2% less damage than the latent power set, but offers a lot
      of quality of life, making this my go to set for most late game investigation hunts.
