    <Comment> last updated for august balance update </Comment>

    <p>
      These are the current endgame builds for Title Update 2, which added Seregios and Lagiacrus.
      All of these builds assume you've completed the main story and have access to the highest
      rarity Artian weapons, plus pretty much all decorations and armor pieces.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="Weapons" />

    <p>
      Artian weapons are still the best option in the game by a wide margin. They all come with
      three level-3 slots, which lets you stack the weapon skills that lance really needs. The
      reinforcement system also gives them the best stats for almost every element or status, making
      most craftable lances pretty obsolete (for thunder the Lagiacrus lance is pretty good).
    </p>

    <p>
      When crafting new Artian weapons, try to get three parts with the same element or status and
      all having attack infusions. This basically guarantees you to get the element you want while
      maximizing the attack production bonus.
    </p>

    <ImageCard
      src={reinforcements}
      alt="reinforcement bonuses"
      caption="A fire Artian lance with full raw production bonus and 2 sharpness, 1 affinity and 1 affinity production bonus. Not the god roll, but still a very good one."
      maxWidth="500px"
    />

    <p>
      For reinforcement bonuses, aim for 1 sharpness and 4 attack. Anything that has 1 sharpness and
      at least 2 raw is considered a good roll and pretty much beats all craftable weapons (except
      for thunder).
    </p>

    <SectionSubSubTitle title="Weapon Decorations" />

    <p>Here's how to use those 3 weapon decoration slots:</p>
    <StyledList
      items={[
        {
          text: 'Offensive Guard 3',
          subtext: "Lance's most important weapon skill for damage",
          emoji: '⚔️',
        },
        {
          text: "Master's Touch 3 or Razor Sharp 3",
          subtext: 'Essential for maintaining sharpness during long fights',
          emoji: '🗡️',
        },
        {
          text: 'Critical Boost 3',
          subtext: 'Great damage skill, but prioritize the other two first',
          emoji: '💥',
        },
      ]}
    />

    <p>
      Offensive Guard comes with combo decorations that include guard, handicraft, or elemental
      attack. Pick based on what you need—guard for tough matchups, handicraft if you're struggling
      with sharpness, or elemental attack for a small damage boost.
    </p>

    <p>
      With our high affinity builds (around 80% average), Master's Touch becomes more effective than
      Razor Sharp for sharpness management. At 80% affinity, Master's Touch effectively multiplies
      your sharpness by 2.78x, giving Artian lances around 138 effective hits compared to Razor
      Sharp's flat doubling (100-120 hits depending on your combo decoration choice).
    </p>

    <SectionSubSubTitle title="Craftable Weapons" />

    <p>
      The Lagiacrus lance actually beats the Artian Thunder Lance in very elemental-heavy matchups
      like Seregios and if you manage to reach high thunder resistance. For longer hunts, an Artian
      with god roll probably still wins due to better slots, giving it better sharpness.
    </p>

    <InfoBox>
      <p>
        When using the Lagi Lance, eat a meal that gives elemental resistances and use your 1-slots
        for more thunder resistance.
      </p>
    </InfoBox>

    <p>
      For other craftable options, the <CodeBlock text="Blazing Sital" /> from Zoh Shia has a unique
      weapon skill, while the Guardian Rathalos lance <CodeBlock text="Shining Pillar" /> offers good
      stats and slot efficiency.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="Element vs Raw" />
    <p>
      Since Artian weapons can all reach the same raw damage, using elemental ones just adds free
      damage on top. If possible, craft 6 different Artian lances (one for each element plus one
      status/raw weapon) to maximize your damage potential across all matchups.. Using the right
      element typically adds 5-10% damage, which really adds up over time.
    </p>

    <p>Check the matchup table to see which element works best against each monster.</p>

    <NavigationButton href="/wilds/data/match-ups" text="matchup chart" emoji="📊" />

    <p>
      If you want to stick with raw weapons, blast is generally the best option, though paralysis is
      also solid for the openings it creates.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="RNG Charms" />

    <p>
      The latest update added a new charm system. Unfortunately they are all random and not that
      good, unless you get a really really good one (probably considered a god charm), sticking to
      the craftable charms is still better.
    </p>

    <p>So what is a really good charm? A good charm gives you:</p>

    <StyledList
      items={[
        {
          text: 'Armor Skills',
          subtext: '1 point of Wex/Agi or Burst',
          emoji: '🛡️',
        },
        {
          text: 'Weapon Skills',
          subtext: 'All 3 levels of Offensive Guard or Razor Sharp',
          emoji: '🗡️',
        },
      ]}
    />

    <p>
      As you can see, the needed charm is pretty crazy, but what it allows you to do is slot in the
      remaining 2 levels of crit boost into the freed weapon slot at the cost of dropping 1 level of
      Agitator. Doing so results in around a 1-2% damage increase, which is pretty low considering
      the estimated effort you need to put in to obtain such a charm.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="Armor" />
    <p>
      All three builds here use Guts, the set bonus from wearing 3 pieces of any Arch-Tempered Apex
      monster armor. Guts lets you survive a lethal hit if you're above 40% health, and as long as
      it hasn't been triggered recently, it gives you a 5% raw damage bonus. Combined with how
      skill-efficient these armor pieces are, it makes Guts one of the strongest skills available.
    </p>

    <p>
      The builds are very similar in damage output, but each has different strengths and use cases.
    </p>

    <p>Now with all that covered, let's take a look at the builds.</p>

    <InfoBox type="warning">
      <p>
        All builds use craftable charms since RNG charms with meaningful damage increases are too
        rare to rely on as a baseline requirement.
      </p>
    </InfoBox>
  </Section>

  <Section title="latent power set" emoji="💪">
    <p>
      This build uses 3 pieces of Rey Dau combined with the best-in-slot armor pieces available,
      letting us max out both Agitator and Weakness Exploit.
    </p>

    <p>
      The key feature is high Latent Power levels, giving this set the highest theoretical damage
      output. The downside is that Latent Power can be inconsistent, as it has high up and down
      times. And when the up times overlap with zone transitions, or timings in the fight where you
      can't attack or deal less damage due to monster states, it can lead to damage loss.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you get hit a lot, you actually will have a higher latent power uptime. If this is an
      advantage solely depends on you :)
    </p>

  <Section title="azure bolt set" emoji="⚡">
    <p>
      This set uses 2 pieces of Lagiacrus for the Azure Bolt set bonus, trading some raw power for
      much more consistent damage output.
    </p>

    <p>
      While the Lagiacrus pieces make this slightly weaker than the Latent Power set on paper, Azure
      Bolt provides more reliable affinity uptime with shorter cycles. The set bonus also adds free
      damage procs that aren't reflected in the displayed stats. We also get 2 levels of Stamina
      Surge, which helps maintain Maximum Might uptime.

  <Section title="comfy zoh shia set" emoji="❤️‍🩹">
    <p>
      Alternatively, there's this third set which is a really comfy variant using the Zoh Shia super
      recovery set bonus, which allows you to recover health passively even without having red
      health. This is really nice for us, as it can help a lot with damage building up from chip or
      smaller hits, meaning you need to heal less often, allowing you to focus more on attacking.
    </p>

    <p>
      Overall, this set has only around 1-2% less damage than the latent power set, but offers a lot
      of quality of life, making this my go to set for most late game investigation hunts.
