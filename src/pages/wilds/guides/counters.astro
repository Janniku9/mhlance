    <p>
      Wilds introduced a arsenal of new defensive options that fundamentally change how Lance
      approaches combat. Each guard and counter technique serves distinct purposes, offering
      different levels of protection, damage potential, and follow-up opportunities. Mastering these
      tools transforms Lance from a simple poke-and-block weapon into a sophisticated
      counter-attacking powerhouse.
    </p>
  </Section>

  <Section title="Charged Counter (CC)">
    <p>
      Charged Counter stands as Lance's most devastating new tool: a scalable counter that grows
      stronger the deeper you are in your combo sequence. The mechanic elegantly rewards aggressive
      play by granting higher damage multipliers based on your current combo position.
    </p>

    <p>
      The charge system works intuitively: each attack in your three-hit combo sequence increases
      your starting charge level. Starting from neutral gives you level 0 (briefly), after one
      attack you begin at level 1, after two attacks you start at level 2, and after three attacks
      you immediately reach the maximum level 3 charge.
    </p>

    <StyledList
      items={[
        {
          text: 'Level 1 Charge Counter deals 20% more damage (white)',
          emoji: '1️⃣',
        },
        {
          text: 'Level 2 Charge Counter deals 40% more damage (yellow)',
          emoji: '2️⃣',
        },
        {
          text: 'Level 3 Charge Counter deals 70% more damage (red)',
          emoji: '3️⃣',
        },
      ]}
    />

    <p>
      While you can manually charge from any level to increase damage further, this rarely proves
      worthwhile in practice. The time spent charging could usually be better invested in additional
      pokes before triggering the counter.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="The Counter Mechanism" />

    <p>
      To successfully perform a Charged Counter you need to release it just before an attack
      connects. This precise timing triggers an "offset attack" that grants i-frames, negating all
      damage regardless of your guard skill investment. Even attacks that normally require Guard Up
      become completely "blockable" through this counter window.
    </p>

    <p>
      Successfully offsetting an attack delivers two damage instances instead of one, dramatically
      increasing the total damage output. Combined with the charge level multipliers, a successful
      red-level offset represents some of the highest damage attacks Lance can perform.
    </p>

    <p>
      Funnily enough, even though you i-frame through the attack (not block it), it still procs the
      Offensive Guard skill, making it this the best counter in the game, especially if used at
      yellow or red charge level.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="Counter Chaining" />
    <p>
      You can even chain charged counters together, but the timing is a bit tricky: input the next
      counter after both damage numbers appear and the lance begins retracting toward neutral
      position. If you press too early, you will just perform a high thrust, too late and you might
      not be in time to counter the next attack.
    </p>

    <p>
      This technique allows back-to-back counters against deliberate monster combinations, though it
      requires good knowledge of attack timings.
    </p>
  </Section>

  <Section title="Perfect Guard (PeG)">
    <p>
      Perfect Guard is performed by pressing the guard button right before the monster hits you. If
      done right, you will see a white flash and the counter shield attack deals increased damage
      and KO. Additionally, all follow up attacks are significantly stronger.
    </p>

    <p>For the follow up attacks, you have three different options:</p>

    <StyledList
      items={[
        {
          text: 'Retribution Thrust',
          emoji: '⚡',
          subtext:
            'A very quick thrust that deals medium damage, but allows you to attack or block again immediately. In most cases, this is what you want to use, as it allows you to chain perfect block on very quick attacks while still squeezing in some damage.',
        },
        {
          text: 'Retribution Thrust',
          emoji: '💥',
          subtext:
            'A slow attack where you jump back and then thrust forward, dealing good damage with the option to follow up with a dash attack. This makes it a really good option for situations where you actually have the time to perform it and the dash attack.',
        },
        {
          text: 'Payback Thrust',
          emoji: '💸',
          subtext:
            "A slow attack where you jump forward and thrust upwards, dealing mediocre damage. This is option honestly doesn't see much use, as the damage and speed are bad so you usually wanna choose between the first two options.",
        },
      ]}
    />

    <SectionSubTitle title="When to choose Perfect Guard?" />

    <p>
      Perfect Guard functions best as a defensive safety net rather than a primary strategy. While
      Charged Counter and Grand Retribution Thrust typically offer superior damage and utility,
      Perfect Guard shines in specific scenarios:
    </p>

    <StyledList
      items={[
        {
          text: 'Panic situations where you lack time to charge a counter',
          emoji: '⏱️',
        },
        {
          text: 'Multi-hit attacks that Charged Counter struggles to handle',
          emoji: '🔄',
        },
        {
          text: 'Extremely fast attack chains that require immediate defensive responses',
          emoji: '⚡',
        },
      ]}
    />

    <p>So think of the perfect guard as a last resort option, a panic button.</p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="Guard Skill Interactions" />

    <p>
      So when you compare blocking attacks with guard level 0, using normal block and perfect guard,
      you will notice that the perfect guard results in less chip damage and faster recovery. This
      is because I assume that perfect guard has some sort of build-in guard levels. If you start
      including guard levels, it will start to get weird though, as it doesn't seem to scale with
      it.
    </p>

    <p>
      No matter if you have guard level 0 or 3, it seems you always take the same amount of
      knockback and chip damage, when using perfect guard, completely ignoring the guard level,
      which is a very weird game design choice, basically making it impossible to improve the
      knockback and lag you take on strong attacks, when using perfect guard.
    </p>
  </Section>

  <Section title="Power Guard (PoG)">
    <p>
      Power Guard returns from previous games with enhanced functionality, creating a specialized
      defensive stance that opens unique counter opportunities. Activate it by holding the dodge
      button while blocking or charging a counter, entering a distinctive stance with 360-degree
      protection.
    </p>

    <p>
      The stance offers several defensive advantages: complete directional coverage eliminates the
      need to face attacks directly, and the continuous stamina drain system allows indefinite
      blocking as long as stamina remains available. This makes Power Guard excellent for handling
      complex multi-hit combinations without worrying about stamina depletion on individual blocks.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, Power Guard increases chip damage compared to normal blocking, creating a meaningful
      trade-off between defensive utility and health preservation. Unlike Iceborne, Wilds does not
      have the automatic Guard Up effect, so unblockable attacks remain unblockable regardless of
      Power Guard duration.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="Grand Retribution Thrust (GRT)" />

    <p>
      Power Guard's primary value lies in accessing Grand Retribution Thrust, potentially Lance's
      highest-damage attack when conditions align properly. Blocking any attack while in Power Guard
      fills a hidden meter visible through your lance's glow intensity.
    </p>

    <p>The meter progression affects GRT damage significantly:</p>

    <StyledList
      items={[
        {
          text: 'White',
          emoji: '⬜',
          subtext:
            'minimum you need to perform the Grand Retribution Thrust. Blocking any attack will at least give you this level.',
        },
        {
          text: 'Orange',
          emoji: '🟧',
          subtext: 'Boosts the damage of the Grand Retribution Thrust by 40%.',
        },
        {
          text: 'Red',
          emoji: '🟥',
          subtext: 'Boosts the damage of the Grand Retribution Thrust by 70%.',
        },
      ]}
    />

    <p>
      Grand Retribution Thrust executes as a backward leap followed by a devastating forward thrust
      dealing three damage ticks instead of the typical two. A GRT at red level is the highest
      damage attack Lance can perform, surpassing even the Charged Counter.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="When to use Power Guard and GRT?" />

    <p>
      Despite its damage potential, GRT carries several practical limitations that prevent it from
      replacing Charged Counter as the primary strategy:
    </p>

    <StyledList
      items={[
        {
          text: 'It is slower requiring a longer opening to perform, especially if you want to use it\s full potential and follow up with the dash attack.',
        },
        {
          text: 'It requires you to block a strong attack so you can get to red level immediately. Blocking a strong attack often means you will take a lot of chip damage.',
        },
        {
          text: 'To prevent chip damage and knockback, you can slot in guard levels, but this means most likely you need to sacrifice other skills you would use otherwise',
        },
        {
          text: 'Power Guard drains stamina continuously, meaning skills like max might turn off, making you uptime worse.',
        },
        {
          text: "Because you are in power guard, it\s impossible to proc offensive guard, meaning you will not get the damage boost from it unless it's already active",
        },
      ]}
    />

    <p>
      But even with all these downsides, there's still plenty of use cases. First of all, many
      monsters have roars that for some reason just give you a free red level + there's also some
      attacks that barely chip you, but still give red level, and then there's one more thing we
      haven't talked about yet, which is an advanced tenchnique you can do with GRT that probably is
      the highest damage gap closer we can do.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="GRT Jump Tech" />
    <p>
      So as we learned when performing the Grand Retribution Thrust, you will jump back before
      jumping forward with a thrust. Now there's a really cool tech where you can combine these two
      movements into the same direction, allowing you to close larger gaps and dealing massive
      damage in the process.
    </p>

    <p>
      While performing this tech, it's also the only time ever we want to exit focus mode, as
      otherwise we aren't able to perform it. So to perform the GRT Jump Tech you want to:
    </p>

    <StyledList
      items={[
        {
          text: 'Exit Focus Mode, face away from your target (hold stick backward), begin charging a counter',
          emoji: '🚪',
        },
        {
          text: 'Enter Power Guard just before impact, then input GRT after blocking',
          emoji: '⚡',
        },
        {
          text: 'Re-enable Focus Mode during the backward leap, aiming toward the monster to redirect the forward thrust',
        },
      ]}
    />

    <p>
      This technique is quite complicated and takes some practice to get right, but once you master
      it, it will open up a way to punish certain attacks harder than ever before.
    </p>
  </Section>

  <Section title="Guard Dash (GD)">
    <p>
      Guard Dash is also back in this game, but because of the triple thrust finisher and the nerf
      of leaping thrust, it barely sees any use.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even when you want to use it as a gap closer, like in some older games, you know have better
      options, as you can perform a leaping thrust out of neutral, by pressing both poke buttons at
      the same time. And most of the time this distance is enough, making it a better option because
      you deal damage and it's faster than doing a guard dash into a leaping thrust.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unless you need the extra mobility range or defensive coverage during positioning, alternative
      gap closers generally prove more efficient and damaging.
