      Wilds introduced a arsenal of new defensive options that fundamentally change how Lance
      approaches combat. Each guard and counter technique serves distinct purposes, offering
      different levels of protection, damage potential, and follow-up opportunities. Mastering these
      tools transforms Lance from a simple poke-and-block weapon into a sophisticated
      counter-attacking powerhouse.
    </p>
  </Section>

  <Section title="Charged Counter (CC)">
    <p>
      Charged Counter is Lance's most powerful new tool: a counter that completely negates all
      damage and grows stronger the higher the charge level is.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each attack in your three-hit combo sequence increases your starting charge level. Starting
      from neutral gives you level 0 (briefly), after one attack you begin at level 1, after two
      attacks you start at level 2, and after three attacks you immediately reach the maximum level
      3 charge. Each level is represented by a different color and

        This is a clip of Arch Tempered Uth Duna, where the hunter keeps stacking up to red level
        with 3 pokes, then performs a max level charged counter, aligning perfectly with the
        monster's attack pattern.
      </p>
    </GifCard>

    <p>
      While you can manually charge from any level to increase damage further, this rarely proves
      worthwhile in practice as it's faster to simply perform additional pokes to reach the desired
      charge level.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="The Counter Mechanism" />

    <p>
      To successfully perform a Charged Counter you need to release it just before an attack
      connects. This precise timing triggers a counter that grants i-frames, negating all damage
      regardless of your guard skill investment. Even attacks that normally require Guard Up become
      completely "blockable" through this counter window.
    </p>

    <p>
      Successfully countering an attack delivers two damage instances instead of one, dramatically
      increasing the total damage output. Combined with the charge level multipliers, a successful
      red-level counter represents some of the highest damage attacks Lance can perform.
    </p>

    <p>
      Funnily enough, even though you i-frame through the attack (not block it), it still procs the
      Offensive Guard skill, making this one of the best counters in the game, especially if used at
      yellow or red charge level.
    </p>

    >
      We transition into a charged counter from the mid-thrust combo, countering Lagiacrus's big AOE
      thunder attack. This attack actually has 3 hitboxes, but a well timed Charged Counter allows
      us to negate all of them. We stand still for a bit, until after all hitboxes have passed,
      before we start poking again.
    </GifCard>

    <p>
      Charged Counter also has this unique property, that if you counter a multi-hit attack, like
      Zoh Shia's Flame Breath or the Lagiacrus's Thunder AOE, for as long as you don't press any
      buttons (including move stick) afterwards, you'll ignore all future hitboxes of that attack.
      This is very useful, as it allows you to just wait out some longer multi-hit attacks that
      would otherwise chip you to death.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="Counter Chaining" />
    <p>
      You can even chain charged counters together, but the timing is a bit tricky: input the next
      counter after both damage numbers appear and the lance begins retracting toward neutral
      position. If you press too early, you will just perform a high thrust, too late and you might
      not be in time to counter the next attack.
    </p>

    <p>
      This technique allows back-to-back counters against certain monster attack patterns, though it
      requires good knowledge of attack timings.

  <Section title="Perfect Guard (PeG)">
    <p>
      Perfect Guard is performed by pressing the guard button right before the monster hits you. If
      done right, you will see a white flash and the counter shield attack deals increased damage
      and KO. Additionally, all follow up attacks are significantly stronger.
    </p>

    <p>For the follow up attacks, you have three different options:</p>

          subtext:
            'A slow attack where you jump back and then thrust forward, dealing good damage with the option to follow up with a dash attack. This makes it a really good option for situations where you actually have the time to perform it and the dash attack.',
        },

          emoji: '💸',
          subtext:
            "A slow attack where you jump forward and thrust upwards, dealing mediocre damage. This is option honestly doesn't see much use, as the damage and speed are bad so you usually wanna choose between the first two options.",
        },
      ]}
    />

      <p>
        Nu Udra has a very quick attack chain, where the first attack has enough time to perform a
        charged counter on it, on the second attack we do a perfect guard and because the third
        attack is very quick, we follow up with a return thrust into another perfect guard. The
        final attack leaves Nu Udra open so we can perform a Retribution Thrust out of the perfect
        guard.
      </p>
    </GifCard>
    <SectionSubTitle title="When to choose Perfect Guard?" />

    <p>
      Perfect Guard functions best as a defensive safety net rather than your primary defensive
      option. While Charged Counter and Grand Retribution Thrust typically offer superior damage and
      utility, Perfect Guard shines in some situations:
    </p>

    <StyledList
      items={[
        {
          text: 'Multi-hit attacks or fast attack Chains that Charged Counter struggles to handle',
          emoji: '🔄',
        },
        {
          text: 'Panic situations where you lack time to charge a counter',
          emoji: '⏱️',
        },
      ]}
    />

    <p>So think of the perfect guard as a last resort option, a panic button.</p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="Guard Skill Interactions" />

    <p>
      So when you compare blocking attacks with guard level 0, using normal block and perfect guard,
      you will notice that the perfect guard results in less chip damage and faster recovery. This
      is because perfect guard has some built in levels of guard. Unfortunately, this seems to be
      fixed though, and does not scale with the guard skill, meaning that you can't improve the
      perfect guard knockback or chip damage with guard skills.
    </p>

    <p>
      So no matter if you have guard level 0 or 3, it seems you always take the same amount of
      knockback and chip damage, when using perfect guard, completely ignoring the guard level,
      which is a very weird game design choice, basically making it impossible to improve the
      knockback and lag you take on strong attacks, when using perfect guard.
    </p>
  </Section>

  <Section title="Power Guard (PoG)">
    <p>
      Power Guard returns from previous games with a new hidden meter mechanic. You can enter Power
      Guard by holding the dodge button while blocking or charging a counter, entering a distinctive
      stance with 360-degree guard angle.
    </p>

    <p>
      The stance offers several defensive advantages: it allows blocking attacks from all
      directions, and the continuous stamina drain system allows indefinite blocking as long as
      stamina remains available. This makes Power Guard excellent for handling complex multi-hit
      combinations or attacks from multiple angles.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, Power Guard increases chip damage compared to normal blocking, creating a trade-off
      for better stamina management and stronger follow ups at the cost of taking more damage.
      Unlike Iceborne, Wilds does not have the automatic Guard Up effect, so unblockable attacks
      remain unblockable regardless of Power Guard duration.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="Grand Retribution Thrust (GRT)" />

    <p>
      Power Guard's primary value lies in it's strong follow ups and new level mechanic, allowing
      access to Grand Retribution Thrust, Lance's highest-damage attack when conditions align
      properly. Blocking any attack while in Power Guard fills a hidden meter visible through your
      lance's glow intensity.
    </p>

    >
      <p>
        Versus Rey Dau, when he does the double wing attack, you can Charge Counter the first one,
        then you could do another CC on the second one, but since your combo will be max at level 1
        (giving you a low damage CC), you can also do a GRT with guaranteed orange level, dealing
        slightly more damage and being able to punish the wide opening with a triple thrust or a
        dash attack immediately after.
      </p>
    </GifCard>

    <p>
      Grand Retribution Thrust executes as a backward leap followed by a devastating forward thrust
      dealing three damage ticks instead of the typical two. A GRT at red level is the highest
      damage attack Lance can perform, surpassing even the Charged Counter.
    </p>

    <p>
      GRT isn't the only follow up from Power Guard, there's also other follow-up attacks like
      Leaping Thrust. In some situations, this boosted leaping thrust can also be a valid option as
      it's very quick, deals good damage, and closes quite a bit of distance.
    </p>

    <p>The meter progression affects follow up attack damage significantly:</p>

    <StyledList

          text: 'White',
          emoji: '⬜',
          subtext:
            'minimum you need to perform the Grand Retribution Thrust. Blocking any attack will at least give you this level. It buffs attacks by 10%',

    />

    <Comment>
      the level buff only applies to the raw damage part. Element attack does not get boosted.
    </Comment>

    <SectionSubTitle title="When to use Power Guard and GRT?" />

    <p>
      Despite its damage potential, GRT carries several practical limitations that prevent it from
      replacing Charged Counter as the primary Counter option:
    </p>

    <StyledList
      items={[
        {
          text: 'It is slower requiring a longer opening to perform, especially if you want to use it\s full potential and follow up with the dash attack.',
        },
        {
          text: 'It requires you to block a strong attack so you can get to red level immediately. Blocking a strong attack often means you will take a lot of chip damage.',
        },
        {
          text: 'To prevent chip damage and knockback, you can slot in guard levels, but this means most likely you need to sacrifice other skills you would use otherwise',
        },
        {
          text: 'Power Guard drains stamina continuously, meaning skills like max might turn off, making you uptime worse.',
        },
        {
          text: "Because you are in power guard, it\s impossible to proc offensive guard, meaning you will not get the damage boost from it unless it's already active",
        },
      ]}
    />

    <p>
      But even with all these downsides, there's still some use cases. First of all, many monsters
      have roars that for some reason just give you a free red level, in many situations it's also
      better than doing a charged counter on no combo and you know you get orange or red on the GRT.
      Additionally, there's an advanced trick (covered in the next section) to increase the range,
      allowing you to punish attacks you otherwise couldn't reach.
    </p>

    <p>
      Especially with the august balance patch, increasing GRT damage and reducing power guard chip
      damage, make this move a lot more viable than before.
    </p>

    <p>
      So to summarize, Power Guard and Grand Retribution Thrust are good when you have no charge
      level for a charged counter and you know you can get a red level buff on the power guard. It
      can also be used for gap closing, as charged counter is very stationary.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="GRT Jump Tech" />
    <p>
      Let's look at how to get even more out of GRT: as we learned when performing the Grand
      Retribution Thrust, you will jump back before jumping forward with a thrust. Now there's a
      really cool tech where you can combine these two movements into the same direction, allowing
      you to close even larger gaps and dealing massive damage in the process.
    </p>

    <p>To perform the GRT Jump Tech you want to:</p>

    <StyledList
      items={[
        {
          text: 'Exit Focus Mode, face away from your target (hold stick backward), begin charging a counter',
          emoji: '🚪',
        },
        {
          text: 'Enter Power Guard just before impact, then input GRT after blocking',
          emoji: '⚡',
        },
        {
          text: 'Re-enable Focus Mode during the backward leap, aiming toward the monster to redirect the forward thrust',
        },
      ]}
    />

      title="Styling on Monsters with GRT Jump Tech"
    >
      <p>
        We can see two use cases of the GRT Jump Tech against Mizutsune here. In the first case,
        both a Charged Counter or a GRT facing the monster don't have enough range to punish. In the
        second scenario using the GRT Jump Tech allows us to get and punish on the head hitzone
        instead of being stuck on the tail or body.
      </p>
    </GifCard>

    <p>
      This technique is quite complicated and takes some practice to get right, but once you master
      it, it will open up a way to punish certain attacks harder than ever before + you will look
      really cool doing it.
    </p>
  </Section>

  <Section title="Guard Dash (GD)">
    <p>
      Guard Dash is also back in this game, but because of the triple thrust finisher and the nerf
      of leaping thrust, it barely sees any use.
    </p>

    <p>
      Even when you want to use it as a gap closer, like in some older games, you know have better
      options, as you can perform a leaping thrust out of neutral, by pressing both poke buttons at
      the same time. And most of the time (thanks to the august balance patch) this distance is more
      than enough, making it a better option because you deal damage and don't lose stamina.
