      Combos are an essential part of lance gameplay in all Monster Hunter games. Lance typically
      allows three actions before resetting the combo tree. In Wilds specifically, we gain many new
      options to reset combos beyond the standard back hop or guard dash.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="Understanding Combo Mechanics" />
    <p>
      Charge Counter adds an additional layer to lance's combo system, as its power increases
      depending on how far you are into the combo. In some situations, you might want to use a
      slower or less powerful attack just to reach the final red level of Charged Counter at the
      optimal time.
    </p>

    <p>
      While in focus mode, mid thrusts allow you to strafe in all four directions, enabling small
      movement adjustments while attacking. High thrusts let you turn in any direction and reach
      higher targets, which is sometimes required to properly hit monster hitzones.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="Neutral" />
    <p>
      With the august balance update, we saw massive buffs the the wide sweep, both a raw and
      elemental damage increase, and when you perform it as the second attack in your combo, the
      third poke will come out ways faster.
    </p>

    <p>
      This makes it pretty much one of lance's best dps options in terms of damage coming from non
      counters.
    </p>

    <p>
      So in neutral you want to use as many wide sweeps and high thrusts as possible, while using
      mid thrusts for positioning. The wide sweep is still rather slow, so you really only want to
      squeeze it in when you know the monster's opening is long enough. But over time you'll learn
      these openings and how to maximize your damage output.
    </p>

  <Section title="Bread and Butter Combos">
    <p>
      All possible combos in Wilds perform similarly, but here's the ones that stand out. These work
      best when the monster is downed or you have a bigger opening. Almost all variations have a
      leaping thrust variation, that is slightly weaker in terms of damage, but allows for easier
      reposition/gap closing and is usually a good way to start the combo when a monster falls over.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="High Thrust Wide Sweep Counter" />

    <p>
      With the wide sweep and high thrust buff, the best combo obviously includes both of these
      moves. Due to the increased wide sweep recovery, and the fact that a poke in third place deals
      more damage than in second place, and the fact that we can't start with a wide sweep, the best
      combo becomes high thrust, wide sweep, high thrust and then one of the finishers.
    </p>

    <p>
      When using a raw or status weapon, it's best to end with a charged counter, as even if you
      don't actually counter anything, it provides more raw dps than the triple thrust finisher.
    </p>

      this combo's motion value per second increased from 44 to 49.2 with the buffs, that's roughly
      a 10% dps increase

    <p>
      If you are at a distance, you can always do the leaping thrust variation to close the gap and
      then transition into the normal combo. You trade a bit of damage for the gap closing ability.
    </p>

      We got a topple on mizu and follow up with Leaping Thrust to easily reach the head and then
      transition into the normal combo.
    </GifCard>

    <p>
      The leaping thrust variation is often the best follow up after a power clash or topple, as it
      usually leaves you at a distance where this combo perfectly catches up to the monster and your
      other follow up options just miss.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another advantage that these sweep combos have is that they are very sharpness efficient, as
      we do slower but heavier hitting attacks, resulting in less hits of sharpness consumed per
      second.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="Mid Thrust Wide Sweep (Elemental)" />

    <p>
      A different variant of the Wide Sweep combo uses Mid Thrusts instead of High Thrusts and ends
      with the Triple Thrust instead of the Charged Counter. This variant is lower in raw damage,
      but higher in elemental damage.
    </p>

    <p>
      Use this combo When you have an elemental weapon (even if it's raw reinforced) and you hit an
      Elemental Hitzone of <strong>15 or higher</strong>, the extra elemental damage makes up for
      the lower raw output and it starts outperforming the High Thrust Wide Sweep combo.
    </p>

    <p>
      Again we can also perform a leaping thrust variation to close the gap and then transition into
      the combo.

      Uth Duna lost the veil and topples, we follow up with a Leaping Thrust and transition into a
      Wide Sweep Mid Thrust, followed by a Triple Thrust.

    <SectionSubTitle title="Mid Thrust Spam (Corrupted Mantle)" />

    <p>
      When using the corrupted mantle, we get additional damage ticks on mid thrusts and triple
      thrusts. The additional damage from corrupted mantle is so significant, it's worth leaving out
      the wide sweep entirely and just looping mid thrusts and triple thrusts.
    </p>

    <ComboCard
      combo={{
        title: 'Mid Thrust Spam',
        longTitle: 'Triple Mid Thrust into Triple Thrust',
        stats: {
          motionValue: 173,
          elementModifier: 7.9,
          sharpnessCost: 4,
          duration: 3.83,
        },
        tags: [ComboTag.DamageElemental, ComboTag.ExecutionSimple, ComboTag.OpportunityShort],
        gif: 'https://assets.mhlance.com/wilds/mt-spam.gif',
        strengths: [
          'Fastest combo to stack Charge Counter',
          'Very high elemental damage and easy to execute',
          'Good for positioning due to strafing',
        ],
        considerations: ['Low damage', 'Consumes slightly more sharpness than other combos'],
        inputs: {
          PlaystationInput: [['Triangle'], ['Triangle'], ['Triangle'], ['Triangle']],
          XboxInput: [['Y'], ['Y'], ['Y'], ['Y']],
          PCInput: [['MouseLeft'], ['MouseLeft'], ['MouseLeft'], ['MouseLeft']],
        },
      }}
    />

    <p>
      The true power of this combo doesn't necessarily come from the damage it deals, but rather
      from it's reaction speed, ability to reposition and because it's the fastest way to reach red
      Charged Counter.
    </p>

    <p>
      So situationally you still want to use it, for example when you need to move slightly to the
      side to hit the weakspot, or if you can fit in a red charged counter into an attack chain
      where wide sweep combos can't.
    </p>

    <InfoBox type="tip">
      <b>Advanced Tip:</b>
      Strafing the third mid thrust is slightly slower than not strafing, so the optimal combo is something
      like: strafe left poke, strafe right poke, neutral poke, then triple thrust. However, this damage
      difference is very very small.
