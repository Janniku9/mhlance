      Combos are an essential part of lance gameplay in all Monster Hunter games. Lance typically
      allows three actions before resetting the combo tree. In Wilds specifically, we gain many new
      options to reset combos beyond the standard back hop or guard dash.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="Understanding Combo Mechanics" />
    <p>
      Charge Counter adds an additional layer to lance's combo system, as its power increases
      depending on how far you are into the combo. In some situations, you might want to use a
      slower or less powerful attack just to reach the final red level of Charged Counter at the
      optimal time.
    </p>

    <p>
      While in focus mode, mid thrusts allow you to strafe in all four directions, enabling small
      movement adjustments while attacking. High thrusts let you turn in any direction and reach
      higher targets, which is sometimes required to properly hit monster hitzones.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="Neutral" />
    <p>
      With the august balance update, we saw massive buffs to the the wide sweep, both a raw and
      elemental damage increase, and when you perform it as the second attack in your combo, the
      third poke will come out way faster.
    </p>

    <p>
      This makes it pretty much one of lance's best dps options in terms of damage outside of
      counters.
    </p>

    <p>
      In neutral, you want to fit in as many wide sweeps as possible due to their high damage.
      However, the wide sweep is slow and commits you to the animation, so you can't use it
      recklessly. Learning which openings allow for a wide sweep becomes essential: Maybe after a
      power clash, maybe after the monster does attack X there's a long opening...
    </p>

    <p>
      On the other hand, you also want to maximize the number of red Charged Counters you can pull
      off. So sometimes it's worth sacrificing a wide sweep if it allows you to reach red counter in
      time. It all comes down to experience and over time you'll learn these openings and how to
      maximize your damage output. In the end most of lance's damage comes from counters and the
      combos are a way to help set them up.

    <p>
      All possible combos in Wilds perform similarly, but here's the ones that stand out and their
      variations.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="Mid Thrust Wide Sweep" />

    <p>
      With the buffs to the triple thrust finisher in Title Update 4, looping <CodeBlock
        >Mid Thrust -> Wide Sweep -> Mid Thrust -> Triple Thrust</CodeBlock
      >
      has become the highest damage combo overall.
    </p>

    <ComboCard
      combo={{
        title: 'Mid Thrust Sweep + Triple',
        longTitle: 'MT Wide Sweep MT Triple Thrust',

        strengths: ['Deals very good raw and element damage', 'Low sharpness consumption'],
        considerations: ['The wide sweep requires bigger commitment and is harder to aim'],
        inputs: {
          PlaystationInput: [['Triangle'], ['Circle', 'Triangle'], ['Triangle'], ['Triangle']],

          PCInput: [['MouseLeft'], ['MouseRight', 'MouseLeft'], ['MouseLeft'], ['MouseLeft']],
        },
      }}
    />

    <p>
      If you are at a distance to the monster, you can always start the combo with a leaping thrust
      instead of the first mid thrust. The leaping thrust is slower and slightly less damage, but it
      allows you to quickly close the distance while also dealing damage.
    </p>

    >
      Uth Duna lost the veil and topples, we follow up with a Leaping Thrust and transition into a
      Wide Sweep Mid Thrust, followed by a Triple Thrust.
    </GifCard>

    <p>
      If you need to rotate by quite a large angle or the monster's weakspot is high up, use high
      thrusts instead of mid thrusts. Performing this combo with high thrusts is slightly weaker
      (1-2%) and slower (less reactive + longer to reach red CC) but it has its advantages and niche
      use cases.
    </p>

    <InfoBox type="tip">
      <b>Quick Summary</b>
      Mid Thrust → Wide Sweep → Mid Thrust → Triple Thrust is the highest damage loop. You can replace
      the first Mid Thrust with a Leaping Thrust for gap closing or a High Thrust to reach higher up
      for slightly less damage.
    </InfoBox>

    <SectionSubTitle title="Mid Thrust Spam (Corrupted Mantle)" />

    <p>
      When using the corrupted mantle, we get additional damage ticks on mid thrusts and triple
      thrusts. The additional damage from corrupted mantle is so significant, it's worth leaving out
      the wide sweep entirely and just looping mid thrusts and triple thrusts.
    </p>

    <ComboCard
      combo={{
        title: 'Mid Thrust Spam',
        longTitle: 'Triple Mid Thrust into Triple Thrust',

        strengths: [
          'Fastest combo to stack Charge Counter',
          'Very high elemental damage and easy to execute',
          'Good for positioning due to strafing',
        ],
        considerations: ['Lower damage', 'Consumes slightly more sharpness than other combos'],
        inputs: {
          PlaystationInput: [['Triangle'], ['Triangle'], ['Triangle'], ['Triangle']],
          XboxInput: [['Y'], ['Y'], ['Y'], ['Y']],
          PCInput: [['MouseLeft'], ['MouseLeft'], ['MouseLeft'], ['MouseLeft']],
        },
      }}
    />

    <p>
      The true power of this combo doesn't come from raw damage, but from its reaction speed,
      repositioning ability, and being the fastest way to reach red Charged Counter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Against aggressive monsters where wide sweeps don't fit cleanly, mid thrust spam keeps you
      safe while still building toward red Charged Counter. It's also useful when you need to strafe
      slightly to stay on a weakspot, or when you want to end your chain with a counter rather than
      committing to a slower finisher.
    </p>

    <InfoBox type="tip">
      <b>Advanced Tip:</b>
      Strafing the third mid thrust is slightly slower than not strafing, so the optimal combo is something
      like: strafe left poke, strafe right poke, neutral poke, then triple thrust. However, this damage
      difference is very very small.
