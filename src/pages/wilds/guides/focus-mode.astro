      Focus Mode is a new mechanic in Wilds that lets you aim your attacks and guards more precisely
      by turning your character toward wherever your camera is facing. While it's active, your
      camera zooms in and your character always faces the camera direction, letting you block
      attacks from any angle and adjust positioning mid-combo.
    </p>
  </Section>

  <Section title="why is focus mode op?">
    <p>
      In older Monster Hunter games, once you started a combo like the triple poke, your direction
      was locked in. If you mispositioned, you'd need to hop or wait to reset before you could aim
      properly again. Focus Mode changes this completely by letting you turn your character
      significantly while performing combos, and even move a little bit.
    </p>

    <p>
      This makes positioning much less critical since you can always adjust without dropping combos,
      or even avoid attacks by moving mid-combo. It's incredibly powerful because positioning, which
      was always a major skill expression factor in previous games, becomes much more forgiving.
    </p>

    <StyledList
      items={[
        {
          text: 'Adjust position and angle during any combo without canceling',
          emoji: '🎯',
        },
        {
          text: 'Block attacks from any direction regardless of starting position',
          emoji: '🛡️',
        },

          text: 'Recover from positioning mistakes without losing offensive pressure',
          emoji: '⚡',
        },
      ]}
    />

    <p>
      The downside is that your camera is slightly zoomed in and it makes the game feel more like a
      hack-and-slash since you can constantly attack while repositioning, rather than the deliberate
      positioning game Monster Hunter traditionally requires.
    </p>

  <Section title="toggle vs hold">
    <p>
      The default Focus Mode controls are pretty awkward since you need to hold multiple buttons,
      often requiring claw grip on controller or uncomfortable hand positions on PC. But since
      there's really no downside to Focus Mode except the zoom and needing to disable it for
      sheathing/using certain items, why not just stay in Focus Mode for the entire fight?
    </p>

    <ImageCard src={focusModeSettings} alt="Focus Mode Settings" maxWidth="1000px">
      <p>
        To make this easier, you can change the Focus Mode controls to a toggle instead of a hold.
        This way, you can just press the button to enter Focus Mode and press it again to exit,
        without needing to hold it down.
      </p>
      <CodeBlock>
        Settings → Keyboard/Controller Configuration → All Melee Weapons → "Focus Mode/Aim Slinger
        Hold" to a button of your choice
      </CodeBlock>
    </ImageCard>

    <p>
      Now you can just press the button when engaging a monster and press it again to turn it off
      when you want to sheathe. Much cleaner and lets you actually use Focus Mode without hand
      cramps.
    </p>

  <Section title="wounds and weakspots">
    <p>
      With the addition of focus mode we also got a new wound system. When you repeatedly hit the
      same monster part, it eventually gets wounded. In Focus Mode, wounds are super easy to spot
      since they're highlighted in red (or blue for tempered wounds), giving you another reason to
      stay in Focus Mode most of the time.
    </p>

    <StyledList
      variant="compact"
      items={[
        {
          text: 'Wounded parts take increased damage until destroyed',
        },
        {
          text: 'Some wounds cause flinches or topples when destroyed (like leg trips)',
        },
        {
          text: 'Blue wounds on tempered monsters always cause free topples',
        },
        {
          text: 'Skills like Weakness Exploit and Flayer synergize with wounds',
        },
      ]}
    />

    <p>
      Preparing and destroying wounds is a very important part of optimal gameplay, since it lets
      you play much more aggressively by constantly getting flinches and free topples.
    </p>

    <p>
      The extra blue wounds on tempered monsters that always result in free topples actually make
      some fights easier than their regular counterparts, since they make the monster fall on the
      ground even more.
    </p>

  <Section title="Focus Strike">
    <p>
      While in Focus Mode, you can perform Focus Strikes on wounded parts that instantly destroy the
      wound and deal significant damage. They can even cancel some monster attacks, lock them in
      place (looking at you switch axe) or just give free flinches.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lance's Focus Strike is a shield bash that triggers a long charge attack when it connects with
      a wound. The charge looks cool but is actually pretty wonky and often makes you miss the
      wounded part with the finisher.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="The Cancel Trick" />
    <p>
      The best way to use the Focus Strike is to: immediately cancel the charge attack by pressing
      the Focus Strike button again. This gives you a quick thrust that's much easier to land on the
      wounded part and deals better DPS than the full animation.
    </p>

    <SectionSubTitle title="Temporary Monster Weakpoints" />
    <p>
      Certain special monster attacks create temporary weakpoints that appear with the same red
      highlight as wounds. These include attacks like Uth Duna's jump, Rey Dau's big thunder
      explosion, and more.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can use Focus Strikes on these temporary weakpoints to deal bonus damage. If you
      successfully destroy them, they deal additional damage and go on cooldown. If you don't
      destroy them in time, they disappear after a short duration.
    </p>

    <p>
      Depending on how long the fight lasts, these temporary weakpoints may become available again
      once their cooldown expires, and the attack is used again.
