  {
    question: 'What does the attack number mean?',
    answer:
      'The ⚔️ number shows Effective Raw (EFR), representing average damage output based on Affinity, Sharpness, Crit Boost and other skills. It helps compare progression builds.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Why are Alatreon/Fatalis at MR 100 when unlocked at MR 24?',
    answer:
      'These are very challenging fights. MR 100 gives access to Guiding Lands materials, Rarity 12 Health Augments, and strong Charms needed to tackle them effectively.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Why do builds use Guard 3/5?',
    answer:
      'Guard 3 becomes necessary in High Rank endgame, while Guard 5 is needed for Iceborne endgame fights. Earlier monsters can be managed with lower Guard levels using Power Guard.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Why is there no Guard Up in early builds?',
    answer:
      "Guard Up requires either Uragaan set bonus (weak armor) or a rare decoration. It's not worth building around until after completing Iceborne's story.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Where are the element sets?',
    answer:
      'Lance has poor elemental modifiers, and endgame lances have high Raw that outclasses elemental options. Alatreon requires elemental weapons, for which we recommend Frostfang Barioth, Safi, or Alatreon lances.',
  },
