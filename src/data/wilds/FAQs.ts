    question: 'Why is guard not a priority?',
    answer:
      "Thanks to Perfect Guard and Charged Counter, we can pretty much block anything without needing guard skills. It being a weapon skill and them being very limited at the moment also doesn't really help. The good thing is that often you can get some levels of guard by using combo decos with Offensive Guard or Sharpness Management.",

    question: 'How much stronger are element sets?',
    answer:
      'As all endgame Artian weapons have the same raw, element is just free bonus damage. In most cases, you end up doing 5-10% more damage if you match element with the monsters weakness.',
